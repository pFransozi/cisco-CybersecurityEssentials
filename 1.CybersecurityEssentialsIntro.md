# 1 Cybersecurity Essentials

## A World of Experts and Criminals

**From the Art of War, one of Sun Tzu's guiding principles was to know your opponent.** Who are our opponents?

**Originally**, the **term hacker** described individuals with advanced programming skills. Hackers used these programming skills to test the limits and capabilities of early systems. But it is important **to understand the cyber culture in order to understand the criminals of the cyber world** and **their motivations**.

## Overview of the Cybersecurity Domains

Besides knowing our opponents, it is fundamental to know the cybersecurity domains.

Companies such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, **could be considered to be data domains in our cyber world** and, extending the analogy further, the people who work at these digital companies could be considered cybersecurity experts.

In general, **a domain is an area that must be protected**, which may be limited by a logical or physical boundary and depends on the size of the the system involved. Furthermore, **cybersecurity experts have to protect their domains according the laws of their own country**, or the laws when the service runs.

**Consider these three cybersecurity domains examples**:

* **In the Google**, the experts created one of the first most powerful domains within the broader cyber world of the Internet. This domain consist of: billions of people using google to search the web every day; and android OS installed on over 80% of all mobile devices connected to the internet.
* **In the Facebook**, we see **a powerful domain within the broader internet**. The experts at FB recognized that people create personal accounts every day to communicate with family and friends. In doing so, you are volunteering a great deal of personal data. 
* **In the LinkedIn**. we can see another data domain and experts recognized that their members would share information in the pursuit of building a professional network.

But why those three examples are cybersecurity domains examples? Looking at in **a fundamental angle**, they are cybersecurity domains, and **a strong kind**, **because of the ability to collect user data contributed by the users themselves**. Often this data includes: users’ backgrounds, discussions, likes, locations, travels, interests, friends and family members, professions, hobbies, and work and personal schedules. From this data, experts create value for the organization.

**How the cyber domains growth?**

Even though cyber domains were only the data collected within the internet from the users that contribute voluntarily, they would already grow. But the cyber domains are not only that. They are as well science and technology evolve with this initial data. Cyber experts now have the technology to track worldwide weather trends, monitor the oceans, as well as the movement and behavior of people, animals and objects in real time. Along with this, new technologies have emerged such as GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) and IoT (Internet of Things). **Whilst those technologies evolve and grow, data collected increases and poses a tremendous challenge for cybersecurity professionals in the future.** The type of data generated by these devices has the potential to enable cyber criminals to gain access to very intimate aspects of daily life.

## Who Are the Cyber Criminals?

From a big picture, there are two kinds of cyber criminals: **the amateurs and the hackers**.

* **amateurs**: as well known as script kiddies. they have little or no skills, often using existing tools or instructions found on the internet to launch attacks. Some are just curious, while others try to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. They may be using basic tools, but the results can still be devastating.
* **hackers**: they break into computers or networks to gain access for various reasons. The intent of the break-in determines the classification of these attackers as white, gray, or black hats.
  * **white hat**: they break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses in order to improve the security of these systems. The owners of the system give permission to perform the break-in, and they receive the results of the test. These are ethical hackers who use their programming skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes. White hat hackers may perform network penetration tests in an attempt to compromise networks and systems by using their knowledge of computer security systems to discover network vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are reported to developers for them to fix before the vulnerabilities can be exploited. Some organizations award prizes or bounties to white hat hackers when they inform them of a vulnerability.
  * **black hat**: they take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain. These are unethical criminals who violate computer and network security for personal gain, or for malicious reasons, such as attacking networks. Black hat hackers exploit vulnerabilities to compromise computer and network systems.
  * **gray hat**: they may find a vulnerability and report it to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda. Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet, so that other attackers can exploit it. These are individuals who commit crimes and do arguably unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage. An example would be someone who compromises a network without permission and then discloses the vulnerability publicly. Gray hat hackers may discloses a vulnerability to the affected organization after having compromised their network. This allows the organization to fix the problem.

**The hackers can be found as organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers.**

**Cyber criminals are usually groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth**. The criminals are highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service. Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness to issues that are important to them. Hacktivists publicly publish embarrassing information about their victims. State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. These attackers are usually highly trained and well-funded. Their attacks focus on specific goals that are beneficial to their government. Some state-sponsored attackers are even members of their nations’ armed forces.

[https://www.sans.org/white-papers/33864/, more about hacker profile.]

**Some situations to see how any kind of hacker acts:**

1. After hacking into ATM machines remotely using a laptop, he worked with ATM manufacturers to resolver the found security vulnerabilities. This is a kind of a **gay hat**.
2. From his laptop, he transferred 10 million to his bank account using victim account numbers and PINs after viewing recordings of victims entering the numbers. Here is a **black hat**.
3. His job is to identify weakness in the computer system in his company. **White hat**.
4. He used malware to compromise several corporate system to steal credit card information and sold that information to the highest bidder. **Black hat**.
5. During his research for security exploits, he stumbled across a security vulnerability on a corp network that he is authorized to access. **White hat**.
6. He is working with technology companies to fix a flaw with DNS. Here is **white hat**.

**What motivate the cyber criminal?**

This is a topic that has changed over the years. Not only the motives have changed, but the hacker profile as well.

* **In the '60s**, hackers started with phone freaking (or phreaking) which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. 
* **In the mid-‘80s**, criminals used computer dial-up modems to connect computers to networks and used password-cracking programs to gain access to data.
* **Nowadays**, criminals are going beyond just stealing information. Criminals can now use malware and viruses as high tech weapons. However, the greatest motivation for most cyber criminals is financial. **Cybercrime has become more lucrative than the illegal drug trade.**

The profiles and motives of moderns hackers are:

* **script kiddies**: the term emerged in the 90s and refers to teenagers or inexperienced hackers running existing scripts, tools, and exploits that could cause harm. It was typically not done for profit.
* **vulnerable broker**: there are usually gray hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendor, sometimes for prizes or rewards.
* **hacktivists**: these are gray hat hackers who rally and protest against different political and social ideas. Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by positing articles, videos, leaking sensitive information, and performing distributed DDoS attacks.
* **cyber criminals**: these are black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations. Each year, cyber criminals are responsible for stealing billions of dollars from consumers and businesses.
* **state-sponsored**: depending on a person's perspective, these are either white hat or black hat hackers who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks. Their targets are foreign government, terrorist groups, and corporations.

## Who are the cybersecurity specialists?

The demand for cybersecurity specialists has grown more than the demand for other IT jobs. All of the technology that transforms the kingdom and **improves people’s way of life also makes it more vulnerable to attacks**. Technology alone cannot prevent, detect, respond and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Consider the following:

* The skill level required for an effective cybersecurity specialist and the shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals translates to higher earning potential.
* Information technology is constantly changing. This is also true for cybersecurity. The highly dynamic nature of the cybersecurity field can be challenging and fascinating.
* A cybersecurity specialist’s career is also highly portable. Jobs exist in almost every geographic location.
* Cybersecurity specialists provide a necessary service to their organizations, countries, and societies, very much like law enforcement or emergency responders.

**One aspect of cybersecurity activities is thwarting cyber criminals**

Thwarting cyber criminals is the most important activity of a cybersecurity specialists and it is the most difficult one. It is hard because there is no such a silver bullet.

Though there is no such a silver bullet, company, government and international organizations have begun to take coordinated actions to limit or fend off cyber criminals, which are:

* **databases of known system vulnerabilities and attack signatures**: it is a unique arrangement of information used to identify an attacker's attempt to exploit a known vulnerability. Organizations share these databases worldwide to help prepare for and fend off many common attacks.
* **Establishing early warning sensors and alert networks**: due to cost and the impossibility of monitoring every network, organizations monitor high-value targets or create imposters that look like high-value targets. Because these high-value targets are more likely to experience attacks, they warn others of potential attacks.
* **Sharing cyber intelligence information**: business, government agencies and countries now collaborate to share critical information about serious attacks to critical targets in order to prevent similar attacks in other places. Many countries have established cyber intelligence agencies to collaborate worldwide in combating major cyberattacks.
* **Establishing information security management standards among national and international organizations**: The **ISO 27000** is a good example of these international efforts.
* **Enacting new laws to discourage cyberattacks and data breaches**: these laws have severe penalties to punish cyber criminals caught carrying out illegal actions.

More details:

* **vulnerability databases**: the national common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) database is an example of the development of a national database. The CVE National Database was developed to provide a publicly available database of all known vulnerabilities. [https://www.cvedetails.com/]
* **early warning systems**: **the honeynet project is** an example of creating Early Warning Systems. The project provides a honeymap which displays real-time visualization of attacks. [https://www.honeynet.org/]
* **share cyber intelligence**: infragard is an example of wide spread sharing of cyber intelligence. The InfraGard program is a partnership between the FBI and the private sector. The participants are dedicated to sharing information and intelligence to prevent hostile cyberattacks. [https://www.infragard.org/]
* **The ISO/IEC 27000**: standards are an example of information security management standards. The standards provide a framework for implementing cybersecurity measures within an organization. [https://www.27000.org/]
* **new laws**: the ISACA group tracks laws enacted related to cyber security. These laws can address individual privacy to protection of intellectual property. Examples of these laws include: cybersecuirty act, federal exchange data breach notification act and the data accountability and trust act. [https://www.isaca.org/]

## common threats to end users

Considering that thwarting the cyber criminals is the most important activity of cybersecurity professionals, it is possible because threats and vulnerabilities are the main concern of cybersecurity professionals.

Two situations are especially critical:
* When a threat is the possibility that a harmful event, such as an attack, will occur.
* When a vulnerability makes a target susceptible to an attack.

Data in the wrong hands can result in a loss of privacy for the owners, can affect their credit, or jeopardize their career or personal relationships.

The greatest risk does not necessarily come from Google or FB or LI. Schools, hospitals, financial institutions, government agencies, the workplace and e-commerce pose even greater risks.

## data, types of personal records

* **medical records**: Doctor's office register results to an electronic health record (EHR). An EHR includes physical health, mental health, and other personal information that may not be medically related. Several laws address protecting patient records. Medical devices, such as fitness bands, use the cloud platform to enable wireless transfer, storage and display of clinical data like heart rates, blood pressures and blood sugars. These devices can generate an enormous amount of clinical data that can become part of a medical record.
* **education records**: Education records include information about grades, test scores, attendance, courses taken, awards, degrees awarded, and disciplinary reports. This record may also include contact information, health and immunization records, and special education records, including individualized education programs (IEPs).
* **employment and financial records**: Employment information can include past employment and performance. Employment records can also include salary and insurance information. Financial records may include information about income and expenditures. Tax records could include paycheck stubs, credit card statements, credit rating and banking information.
* **your data**: data on your computing devices, medical data, employment, information online, your identity, education data, financial data.

## threats

* **internet services threats**: there is a kind of threats that treat the internet services, which means technical services needed for a network, and ultimately the internet, to operate. These services include routing, addressing, domain naming, and database management. **These services also serve as prime targets for cyber criminals**. 
  * **Criminals use packet-sniffing tools to capture data streams over a network**. **This means that all sensitive data, like usernames, passwords and credit card numbers, are at risk**. 
  * **Packet sniffers** work by monitoring and recording all information coming across a network. 
  * **Criminals can also use rogue devices**, such as **unsecured Wi-Fi access points**. If the criminal sets this up near a public place, such as a coffee shop, unsuspecting individuals may sign on and the packet sniffer copies their personal information.
  * **Domain Name Service (DNS)** translates a domain name, such as www.facebook.com, into its numerical IP address. **If a DNS server does not know the IP address, it will ask another DNS server**. **With DNS spoofing (or DNS cache poisoning), the criminal introduces false data into a DNS resolver’s cache**. **These poison attacks exploit a weakness in the DNS software that causes the DNS servers to redirect traffic for a specific domain to the criminal’s computer**, instead of the legitimate owner of the domain.
  * **Packet forgery (or packet injection) interferes** with an established network communication by constructing packets to appear as if they are part of a communication. Packet forgery allows a criminal to disrupt or intercept packets. This process enables the criminal to hijack an authorized connection or denies an individual’s ability to use certain network services. Cyber professionals call this a man-in-the-middle attack.
  * **The examples given only scratch the surface of the types of threats criminals can launch against Internet and network services.**

* **threats to key industry sectors**: Key industry sectors offer networking infrastructure systems such as manufacturing, energy, communication and transportation. 
  * Cyberattacks like **Stuxnet** proved that a cyberattack could successfully **destroy or interrupt critical infrastructures**. Specifically, **the Stuxnet attack targeted the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system used to control and monitor industrial processes**. SCADA can be part of various industrial processes in manufacturing, production, energy and communications systems. 
  * A cyberattack could bring down or interrupt industry sectors like telecommunication, transportation or electrical power generation and distribution systems. It could also interrupt the financial services sector. 
  * One of the problems with environments that incorporate SCADA is the fact that designers did not connect SCADA to the traditional IT environment and the Internet.  Therefore, they did not properly consider cybersecurity during the development phase of these systems. Like other industries, organizations using SCADA systems recognize the value of data collection to improve operations and decrease costs. The resulting trend is to connect SCADA systems to traditional IT systems. However, this increases the vulnerability of industries using SCADA systems.

* **threats to people’s way of Life**: **Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect networked systems and data from unauthorized access**. On a personal level, everyone needs to safeguard his or her identity, data, and computing devices. At the corporate level, it is the employees’ responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data, and customers. At the state level, national security and the citizens’ safety and well-being are at stake.
  * **Cybersecurity professionals are often involved in working with government agencies in identifying and collecting data**.
  * In the U.S., the National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for intelligence collection and surveillance activities. The NSA built a new data center just to process the growing volume of information. In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed the USA Freedom Act ending the practice of collecting U.S. Citizens’ phone records in bulk. **The program provided metadata that gave the NSA information about communications sent and received**.
  * **The efforts to protect people’s way of life often conflicts with their right to privacy**. It will be interesting to see what happens to the balance between these rights and the safety of Internet users.

* internal and external threats
  * **internal security threats**: **Attacks can originate from within an organization or from outside of the organization**. An internal user, such as an employee or contract partner, can accidently or intentionally:
    * Mishandle confidential data
    * Threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices
    * Facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the corporate computer system
    * Accidentally invite malware onto the network through malicious email or websites
  * Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices.
  * Internal attackers typically have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources, and its confidential data. They may also have knowledge of security countermeasures, policies and higher levels of administrative privileges.
  * **external security threats**: External threats from amateurs or skilled attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in networked devices, or can use social engineering, such as trickery, to gain access. External attacks exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities to gain access to internal resources.

* **traditional data**: 
  * Corporate data includes personnel information, intellectual property, and financial data.
    * Intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, allows a business to gain economic advantage over its competitors. Consider this intellectual property as a trade secret; losing this information can be disastrous for the future of the company.
    * Personnel information includes application materials, payroll, offer letters, employee agreements, and any information used in making employment decisions.
    * Financial data, such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, gives insight into the health of the company.

* **The Vulnerabilities of Mobile Devices**: In the past, employees typically used company-issued computers connected to a corporate LAN. Administrators continuously monitor and update these computers to meet security requirements. Today, **mobile devices such as iPhones, smartphones, tablets, and thousands of other devices, are becoming powerful substitutes for, or additions to, the traditional PC**. More and more people are using these devices to access enterprise information. 
  * **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a growing trend**. The inability to centrally manage and update mobile devices poses a growing threat to organizations that allow employee mobile devices on their networks.

* **The Emergence of the Internet of Things**: **The Internet of Things (IoT) is the collection of technologies that enable the connection of various devices to the Internet**. The technological evolution associated with the advent of the IoT is changing commercial and consumer environments. IoT technologies enable people to connect billions of devices to the Internet. These devices include appliances, locks, motors, and entertainment devices, to name just a few. **This technology affects the amount of data that needs protection. Users access these devices remotely, which increases the number of networks requiring protection**.
  * With the emergence of IoT, there is much more data to be managed and secured. All of these connections, plus the expanded storage capacity and storage services offered through the Cloud and virtualization, has led to the exponential growth of data. This data expansion created a new area of interest in technology and business called “Big Data".

* **The Impact of Big Data**: **Big data is the result of data sets that are large and complex, making traditional data processing applications inadequate**. Big data poses both challenges and opportunities based on three dimensions:
  * The volume or amount of data
  * The velocity or speed of data
  * The variety or range of data types and sources
* Companies like Target, Home Depot and PayPal are subjects of highly publicized attacks. As a result, enterprise systems require dramatic changes in security product designs and substantial upgrades to technologies and practices. Additionally, governments and industries are introducing more regulations and mandates that require better data protection and security controls to help guard big data.

## weapons

**Software vulnerabilities today rely on programming mistakes**, **protocol vulnerabilities**, **or system misconfigurations**. The cyber criminal merely has to exploit one of these. For example, a common attack involved constructing an input to a program in order to sabotage the program, making it malfunction. This malfunction provided a doorway into the program or caused it to leak information.

**There is a growing sophistication seen in cyberattacks today**. **An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a continuous computer hack that occurs under the radar against a specific object**. Criminals usually choose an APT for business or political motives. An APT occurs over a long period with a high degree of secrecy using sophisticated malware.

Algorithm attacks can track system self-reporting data, like how much energy a computer is using, and use that information to select targets or trigger false alerts. Algorithmic attacks can also disable a computer by forcing it to use memory or by overworking its central processing unit. Algorithmic attacks are more devious because they exploit designs used to improve energy savings, decrease system failures, and improve efficiencies.

Finally, the new generation of attacks involves intelligent selection of victims. In the past, attacks would select the low hanging fruit or most vulnerable victims. However, with greater attention to detection and isolation of cyberattacks, cyber criminals must be more careful. They cannot risk early detection or the cybersecurity specialists will close the gates of the castle. As a result, many of the more sophisticated attacks will only launch if the attacker can match the object signature targeted.

## broader scope and cascade effect

Federated identity management refers to multiple enterprises that let their users use the same identification credentials gaining access to the networks of all enterprises in the group. This broadens the scope and increases the probability **of a cascading effect should an attack occur**.

**A federated identity links** a subject’s electronic identity across separate identity management systems. For example, a subject may be able to log onto Yahoo! with Google or Facebook credentials. This is an example of social login.

**The goal of federated identity management is to share identity information automatically across castle boundaries. From the individual user’s perspective, this means a single sign-on to the web.**

It is imperative that organizations scrutinize the identifying information shared with partners. Social security numbers, names, and addresses may allow identity thieves the opportunity to steal this information from a partner to perpetrate fraud. The most common way to protect federated identity is to tie login ability to an authorized device.

## Safety Implications

**A telephone denial of service (TDoS) attack uses phone calls against a target telephone network tying up the system and preventing legitimate calls from getting through**. Next generation 911 call centers are vulnerable because they use Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems rather than traditional landlines. In addition to TDoS attacks, these call centers **can also be at risk of distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks** that use many systems to flood the resources of the target making the target unavailable to legitimate users. There are many ways nowadays to request 911 help, from using an app on a smartphone to using a home security system.

## Addressing the Shortage of Cybersecurity Specialists

The National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) created a framework for companies and organizations in need of cybersecurity professionals. The framework enables companies to identify the major types of responsibilities, job titles, and workforce skills needed. The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework categorizes and describes cybersecurity work. It provides a common language that defines cybersecurity work along with a common set of tasks and skills required to become a cybersecurity specialist. The framework helps to define professional requirements in cybersecurity.

* **The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework**: it is categorized into seven categories
  * **Operate and Maintain** includes providing the support, administration, and maintenance required to ensure IT system performance and security. Specialty areas responsible for providing support, administration, and maintenance necessary to ensure effective and efficient information technology (IT) system performance and security.
  * **Protect and Defend** includes the identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats to internal systems and networks. Specialty areas responsible for identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats to internal information technology (IT) systems or networks.
  * **Investigate** includes the investigation of cyber events and/or cyber crimes involving IT resources. Specialty areas responsible for investigation of cyber events and /or crimes of information technology (IT) systems, networks, and digital evidence.
  * **Collect and Operate** includes specialized denial and deception operations and the collection of cybersecurity information. Specialty areas responsible for specialized denial and deception operations and collections fo cybersecurity information that may be used to develop intelligence.
  * **Analyze** includes highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine if it is useful for intelligence. Specialty ares responsible for highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine its usefulness for intelligence.
  * **Oversight and Development** provides for leadership, management, and direction to conduct cybersecurity work effectively. Specialty areas providing leadership, management, direction, and/or development and advocacy so that individuals and organizations may effectively conduct cybersecurity work.
  * **Securely Provision** includes conceptualizing, designing, and building secure IT systems. Specialty areas responsible for conceptualizing, designing, and building secure information technology (IT) systems, i.e., responsible for some aspect of systems development.
