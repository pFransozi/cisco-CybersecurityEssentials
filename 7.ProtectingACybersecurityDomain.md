# 7 Protecting a Cybersecurity Domain

**Protecting your domain is an on-going process to secure an organization’s network infrastructure**. **A secure network is only as strong as its weakest link**. It is important to secure the end devices that reside on the network. **Endpoint security includes securing the network infrastructure devices on the local-area network (LAN) and end systems, such as workstations, servers, IP phones, and access points.** **Device hardening is a critical task when securing the network**. It involves implementing proven methods of physically securing network devices. Some of these methods involve securing administrative access, maintaining passwords, and implementing secure communications.

## OS Security

**The os plays a critical role in the operation of a computer system and is the target of many attacks**. The security of the os has a cascading effect on the overall security of a computer system. **An administrator hardens an operating system by modifying the default configuration to make it more secure to outside threats**.

* removal of unnecessary programs and services
* application of security patches and updates
* an organization should have a systematic approach in place for addressing system updates by:
  * **Establishing procedures for monitoring security-related information**
  * **Evaluating updates for applicability**
  * **Planning the installation of application updates and patches**
  * **Installing updates using a documented plan**
* **identify potential vulnerabilities**
  * can be accomplished by establishing a baseline, which enables the administrator to do a comparison of how a system is performing versus its baseline expectations.
  * **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) assesses missing security updates and security misconfigurations in Microsoft Windows.** It checks:
    * blank, simple, or non-existent passwords
    * firewall settings
    * guest account status
    * administrator account details
    * security event auditing
    * unnecessary services
    * network shares
    * registry settings
  * after hardening the operating system, the administrator **creates the policies and procedures to maintain a high level of security**.

## Antimalware

**Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, spyware, and adware**. **It is important to protect computers and mobile devices using reputable antimalware software**. The following types of antimalware programs are available:

* **Antivirus protection**: ongoing monitoring, when a virus is detected, the program warns the user, and it attempts to quarantine or delete the virus.
* **Adware protection**: ongoing looking for programs that display advertising on a computer.
* **Phishing protection**: it blocks the IP addresses of known phishing websites and warns the user about suspicious sites.
* **Spyware protection**: it scans for keyloggers and other spyware.
* **Trusted / untrusted sources**: it warns the user about unsafe programs trying to install or unsafe websites before a user visits them.

**Be cautious of malicious rogue antivirus products that may appear while browsing the Internet**. Most of these rogue antivirus products display an ad or pop-up that looks like an actual Windows warning window. They usually state that malware is infecting the computer and prompts the user to clean it. 

Unapproved, or non-compliant, software is not just software that a user unintentionally installs on a computer. It can also come from users that meant to install it. It may not be malicious, but it still may violate security policy. This type of non-compliant system can interfere with company software, or network services. Users must remove unapproved software immediately.

## Patch Management

From time to time, manufacturers combine patches and upgrades into a comprehensive update application called a service pack. Many devastating virus attacks could have been much less severe if more users had downloaded and installed the latest service pack. Windows routinely checks the Windows Update website for high-priority updates that can help protect a computer from the latest security threats. These updates include security updates, critical updates, and service packs. Depending on the setting configured, Windows automatically downloads and installs any high-priority updates that the computer needs or notifies the user as these updates become available.

Some organizations may want **to test a patch before deploying it throughout the organization**. The organization would **use a service to manage patches locally instead of using the vendor’s online update service**. The benefits of using an automated patch update service include the following:

* Administrators **can approve or decline updates**
* Administrators **can force the update of systems for a specific date**
* Administrators **can obtain reports on the update needed by each system**
* Each computer does not have to connect to the vendor’s service to download patches; a system gets the update from a local server
* **Users cannot disable or circumvent updates**

An automated patch service provides administrators with a more controlled setting.

## Host-Based Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

**A host-based solution is a software application that runs on a local host computer to protect it. The software works with the operating system to help prevent attacks**.

* **Host-based Firewalls**: A software firewall is a program that runs on a computer to allow or deny traffic between the computer and other connected computers. The user can control the type of data sent to and from the computer by opening or blocking selected ports. Firewalls block incoming and outgoing network connections, unless exceptions are defined to open and close the ports required by a program.
* **Host Intrusion Detection Systems**: A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) is software that runs on a host computer that monitors suspicious activity. Each server or desktop system that requires protection will need to have the software installed. HIDS monitors system calls and file system access to ensure that the requests are not the result of malicious activity. It can also monitor system registry settings. The registry maintains configuration information about the computer. **HIDS stores all log data locally.** **It can also affect system performance because it is resource intensive**. **A HIDS cannot monitor any network traffic that does not reach the host system**, but it does monitor operating system and critical system processes specific to that host.

## Secure Communications

When connecting to the local network and sharing files, the communication between computers remains within that network. Data remains secure because it is off other networks and off the Internet. To communicate and share resources over a network that is not secure, users employ a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

### VPN

**A VPN is a private network that connects remote sites or users together over a public network, like the Internet**. The most common type of VPN accesses a corporate private network. **The VPN uses dedicated secure connections, routed through the Internet, from the corporate private network to the remote user**. When connected to the corporate private network, users become part of that network and have access to all services and resources as if they physically connected to the corporate LAN.

**Remote-access users must have a VPN client installed on their computers to form a secure connection with the corporate private network**. The VPN client software encrypts data before sending it over the Internet to the VPN gateway at the corporate private network. VPN gateways establish, manage, and control VPN connections, also known as VPN tunnels. OSs include a VPN client that the user configures for a VPN connection.

### WEP

One of the most important components of modern computing are mobile devices. The majority of devices found on today’s networks are laptops, tablets, smart phones and other wireless devices. **Mobile devices transmit data using radio signals that any device with a compatible antenna can receive**. For this reason the computer industry has developed a suite of wireless or mobile security standards, products and devices. These standards encrypt information transmitted through the airwaves by mobile devices.

**Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is one of the first and widely used Wi-Fi security standards.** The WEP standard provides authentication and encryption protections. **The WEP standards are obsolete but many devices still support WEP for backwards compatibility**. The WEP standard became a Wi-Fi security standard in 1999 when wireless communication was just catching on. Despite revisions to the standard and an increased key size, WEP suffered from numerous security weaknesses. **Cyber criminals can crack WEP passwords in minutes using freely available software.** Despite improvements, WEP remains highly vulnerable and users should upgrade systems that rely on WEP.

### WPA/WPA2

The next major improvement to wireless security was the introduction of WPA and WPA2. **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was the computer industry’s response to the weakness of the WEP standard**. **The most common WPA configuration is WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Key). The keys used by WPA are 256-bit, a significant increase over the 64-bit and 128-bit keys used in the WEP system**.

The WPA standard provided several security improvements: 
  * WPA provided **message integrity checks (MIC)** which could detect if an attacker had captured and altered data passed between the wireless access point and a wireless client.
  * key security enhancement was **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)**. The **TKIP standard provided the ability to better handle, protect and change encryption keys**. 
    * advanced Encryption Standard (AES) superseded TKIP for even better key management and encryption protection.

**WPA, like its predecessor WEP, included several widely recognized vulnerabilities**. As a result, the release of **Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)** standard happened in 2006. One of the most significant security improvements from WPA to WPA2 was the **mandatory use of AES algorithms and the introduction of Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCM) as a replacement for TKIP.**

### Mutual Authentication

**One of the great vulnerabilities of wireless networks is the use of rogue access points**. **Access points are the devices that communicate with the wireless devices and connect them back to the wired network**.

Any device **that has a wireless transmitter and hardwired interface to a network can potentially act as a rouge or unauthorized access point**. The rouge access point can imitate an authorized access point. The result is that wireless devices on the wireless network establish communication with the rouge access point instead of the authorized access point.

The imposter can receive connection requests, copy the data in the request and forward the data to the authorized network access point. This type of man-in-the-middle attack is very difficult to detect and can result in stolen login credentials and transmitted data. To prevent rouge access points, the computer industry developed mutual authentication. Mutual authentication, also called two-way authentication, is a process or technology in which both entities in a communications link authenticate to each other. In a wireless network environment, the client authenticates to the access point and the access point authenticates the client. This improvement enabled clients to detect rouge access points before connecting to the unauthorized device.

## File Access Control

Permissions are rules configured to limit folder or file access for an individual or for a group of users.

* **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users **should be limited to only the resources they need on a computer system or on a network**. It may be easier to provide users access to the entire drive, but **it is more secure to limit access to only the folder that they need to perform their job**. **Limiting access to resources also prevents malicious programs from accessing those resources if the user’s computer becomes infected**.
* **Restricting User Permissions**: If an administrator denies permissions to a network share for an individual or a group, this denial overrides any other permission settings. The local security policy must outline which resources and the type of access allowed for each user and group.
* **permission propagation**: When a user changes the permissions of a folder, she has the option to apply the same permissions to all sub-folders. Permission propagation is an easy way to apply permissions to many files and folders quickly. After parent folder permissions have been set, folders and files created inside the parent:

* Data moved to the same volume will keep the original permissions
* Data copied to the same volume will inherit new permissions
* Data moved to a different volume will inherit new permissions
* Data copied to a different volume will inherit new permission

|Permission Level|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|Full Control|Users can see the contents of a file or folder, change and delete existing files and folders, create new files and folders, and run programs in a folder|
|Modify|Users can change and delete existing files and folders, but cannot create new ones|
|Read and Execute|Users can see the contents of existing files and folders and can run programs in a folder|
|Read|Users can see the contents of a folder and open files and folders|
|Write|Users can create new files and folders and make changes to existing files and folders|

## File Encryption

**Encryption is a tool used to protect data**. Encryption transforms data using a complicated algorithm to make it unreadable. A special key returns the unreadable information back **into readable data**. Software programs encrypt files, folders, and even entire drives.

**Encrypting File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. The Windows implementation of EFS links it directly to a specific user account. Only the user that encrypted the data will be able to access the encrypted files or folders**.

A user can also choose to encrypt an entire hard drive in Windows using **a feature called BitLocker**. To use BitLocker, at least two volumes must be present on a hard disk. Before using BitLocker, **the user needs to enable Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in the BIOS**. The TPM is a specialized chip installed on the motherboard. The TPM stores information specific to the host system, such as encryption keys, digital certificates, and passwords. Applications, like BitLocker, that use encryption can make use of the TPM chip. 
**BitLocker To Go encrypts removable drives**. BitLocker To Go does not use a TPM chip, but still provides encryption for the data and requires a password.

## System and Data Backups

An organization can lose data if cyber criminals steal it, equipment fails, or a disaster occurs. For this reason, it is important to perform a data backup regularly. **A data backup stores a copy of the information from a computer to removable backup media**. The operator stores the backup media in a safe place. Backing up data is one of the most effective ways of protecting against data loss. If the computer hardware fails, the user can restore the data from the backup once the system is functional.

* The organization’s security policy should include data backups. 
* Users should perform data backups on a regular basis. 
* Data backups are usually stored offsite to protect the backup media if anything happens to the main facility.

These are some considerations for data backups:

* **Frequency**: Backups can take a long time. Sometimes it is easier to make a full backup monthly or weekly, and then do frequent partial backups of any data that has changed since the last full backup. However, having many partial backups increases the amount of time needed to restore the data.
* **Storage**: For extra security, transport backups to an approved offsite storage location on a daily, weekly, or monthly rotation, as required by the security policy.
* **Security**: Protect backups with passwords. The operator then enters the password before restoring the data on the backup media.
* **Validation**: Always validate backups to ensure the integrity of the data.

## Content Screening and Blocking

**Content control software restricts the content that a user can access using a web browser over the Internet**. Content control software can block sites that contain certain types of material such as pornography or controversial religious or political content. A parent may implement content control software on the computer used by a child. Libraries and schools also implement the software to prevent access to content considered objectionable.

An administrator can implement the following types of filters:

* Browser-based filters through a third-party browser extension
* Email filters through a client- or server-based filter
* Client-side filters installed on a specific computer
* Router-based content filters that block traffic from entering the network
* Appliance-based content filtering similar to router based
* Cloud-based content filtering

Search engines such as Google offers the option of turning on a safety filter to exclude inappropriate links from search results.

## Disk Cloning and Deep Freeze

**Many third-party applications are available to restore a system back to a default state. This allows the administrator to protect the operating system and configuration files for a system**.

* **Disk cloning**: it copies the contents of the computer’s hard disk to an image file. The administrator can use the cloned image as follows:
  * To automatically wipe a system and restore a clean master image
  * To deploy new computers within the organization
  * To provide a full system backup
* **Deep Freeze**: it “freezes” the hard drive partition. When a user restarts the system, the system reverts to its frozen configuration. The system does not save any changes that the user makes, so any applications installed or files saved are lost when the system restarts. If the administrator needs to change the system’s configuration, she must first “thaw” the protected partition by disabling Deep Freeze. After making the changes, she must re-enable the program. The administrator can configure Deep Freeze to restart after a user logs out, shuts down after a period of inactivity, or shuts down at a scheduled time.

**These products do not offer real-time protection. A system remains vulnerable until the user or a scheduled event restarts the system. A system infected with malicious code though, gets a fresh start as soon as the system restarts.**

## Security Cables and Locks

There are several methods of physically protecting computer equipment:

* Use cable locks with equipment
* Keep telecommunication rooms locked
* Use security cages around equipment

Many portable devices and expensive computer monitors have a special steel bracket security slot built in to use in conjunction with cable locks. The most common type of door lock is a standard keyed entry lock. It does not automatically lock when the door closes. Additionally, an individual can wedge a thin plastic card such as a credit card between the lock and the door casing to force the door open. Door locks in commercial buildings are different from residential door locks. For additional security, a deadbolt lock provides extra security. Any lock that requires a key, though, poses a vulnerability if the keys are lost, stolen, or duplicated. A cipher lock uses buttons that a user presses in a given sequence to open the door. It is possible to program a cipher lock. This means that a user’s code may only work during certain days or certain times. For example, a cipher lock may only allow Bob access to the server room between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. Cipher locks can also keep a record of when the door opened, and the code used to open it.

## Logout Timers

An employee gets up and leaves his computer to take a break. If the employee does not take any action to secure his workstation, any information on that system is vulnerable to an unauthorized user. An organization can take the following measures to deter unauthorized access:

* **Idle Timeout and Screen Lock**: Employees may or may not log out of their computer when they leave the workplace. Therefore, it is a security best practice to configure an idle timer that will automatically log the user out and lock the screen after a specified period. The user must log back in to unlock the screen.
* **Login Times**: In some situations, an organization may want employees to log in during specific hours, such as 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. The system blocks logins during the hours that fall outside of the allowed login hours.

## GPS Tracking

The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses satellites and computers to determine the location of a device. GPS technology is a standard feature on smartphones that provide real-time position tracking. GPS tracking can pinpoint a location within 100 meters. This technology is available to track children, senior citizens, pets, and vehicles. Using GPS to locate a cell phone without the user’s permission though is an invasion of privacy and it is illegal.

Many cell phone apps use GPS tracking to track a phone’s location. For example, Facebook allows users to check in to a location, which is then visible to people in their networks.

## Inventory and RFID Tags

Radio frequency identification (RFID) uses radio waves to identify and track objects. RFID inventory systems use tags attached to all items that an organization wants to track. The tags contain an integrated circuit that connects to an antenna. RFID tags are small and require very little power, so they do not need a battery to store information to exchange with a reader. RFID can help automate asset tracking or wirelessly lock, unlock, or configure electronic devices.

RFID systems operate within different frequencies. Low frequency systems have a shorter read range and slower data read rates, but are not as sensitive to radio wave interference caused by liquids and metals that are present. Higher frequencies have a faster data transfer rate and longer read ranges, but are more sensitive to radio wave interference.

## Managing Remote Access

Remote access refers to any combination of hardware and software that enables users to access a local internal network remotely.

**With the Windows operating system, technicians can use Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance to repair and upgrade computers**. Remote Desktop allows technicians to view and control a computer from a remote location. Remote Assistance allows technicians to assist customers with problems from a remote location. Remote Assistance also allows the customer to view the repair or upgrade in real time on the screen.

The Windows installation process does not enable remote desktop by default. Enabling this feature opens port 3389 and could result in a vulnerability if a user does not need this service.

### Telnet, SSH, and SCP

**Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that provides a secure (encrypted) management connection to a remote device**. SSH should replace Telnet for management connections. **Telnet is an older protocol that uses unsecure plaintext transmission of both the login authentication (username and password) and the data transmitted between the communicating devices**. SSH provides security for remote connections by providing strong encryption when a device authenticates (username and password) and for transmitting data between the communicating devices. **SSH uses TCP port 22. Telnet uses TCP port 23.**

Cyber criminals **monitor packets using Wireshark**. Cyber criminals capture the username and password of the administrator from the plaintext Telnet session. Cyber criminals track the session using the IP address of the administrator device, but the session encrypts the username and password.

**Secure copy (SCP) securely transfers computer files between two remote systems. SCP uses SSH for data transfer (including the authentication element), so SCP ensures the authenticity and confidentiality of the data in transit.**

## Securing Ports and Services

**Cyber criminals exploit the services running on a system because they know that most devices run more services or programs than they need**. **An administrator should look at every service to verify its necessity and evaluate its risk. Remove any unnecessary services.** A simple method that many administrators use to help secure the network from unauthorized access is **to disable all unused ports on a switch**. The process of enabling and disabling ports can be time-consuming, but it enhances security on the network and is well worth the effort.

## Privileged Accounts

**Cyber criminals exploit privileged accounts because they are the most powerful accounts in the organization.** Privileged accounts have the credentials to gain access to systems and they provide elevated, unrestricted access. Administrators use these accounts to deploy and manage operating systems, applications, and network devices. Organization should adopt the following best practices for securing privileged accounts:

* **Identify and reduce the number of privileged accounts**
* **Enforce the principle of least privilege**
* **Establish a process for revocation of rights** when employees leave or change jobs
* **Eliminate shared accounts with passwords that do not expire**
* **Secure password storage**
* **Eliminate shared credentials for multiple administrators**
* **Automatically change privileged account passwords every 30 or 60 days**
* **Record privileged sessions**
* Implement a process to **change embedded passwords for scripts and service accounts**
* **Log all user activity**
* **Generate alerts for unusual behavior**
* **Disable inactive privileged accounts**
* **Use multi-factor authentication for all administrative access**
* **Implement a gateway between the end-user and sensitive assets to limit network exposure to malware**

Locking down privileged accounts is critical to the security of the organization. Securing these accounts needs to be a continuous process. An organization should evaluate this process to make any required adjustments to improve security.

* Local Administrative Accounts
  * provide unrestricted access to the local host
  * used to perform maintenance on workstations, servers, databases, and network devices
  * shared password across many hosts creates target
* Privileged User Accounts
  * Credentials to give administrative privileges on aone or more systems
  * Used across all managed systems
  * Common practice to monitor the use of these accounts
* Domain Administrative Accounts
  * Provide privileged adminsitrative access to workstations and servers within a Windows domain
  * Provide extensive access across the network
  * Provide control over all domain controllers to modify domain memebership
* Emergency Accounts
  * Provide unprivileged user administrative access to secure systems
  * Used in the case of an emerge#### 7.1.3.2 atabases, run scripts, or provide access to other applications
  * Have broad access to company information residing in applications and databases

## Group Policies

In most networks that use Windows computers, an administrator configures Active Directory with Domains on a Windows Server**. **Windows computers are members of a domain**. **The administrator configures a Domain Security Policy that applies to all computers that join**. **Account policies are automatically set when a user logs in to Windows**.

**Enter secpol.msc at the Run command to open the Local Security Policy tool.** 

An administrator configures user account policies such as password policies and lockout policies by expanding Account Policies > Password Policy. **Users must change their passwords every 90 days and use the new password for at least one (1) day. Passwords must contain eight (8) characters and three of the following four categories: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Lastly, the user can reuse a password after 24 unique passwords.**

An account **Lockout Policy locks** a computer for a configured duration when too many incorrect login attempts occur. **For example, the policy allows the user to enter the wrong username and/or password five times.** After five attempts, **the account locks users out for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the number of attempts resets to zero and the user can attempt to login again.**

**More security settings are available by expanding the Local Policies folder. An Audit Policy creates a security log file used to track the events.**

## Enable Logs and Alerts

An audit log tracks user authentication attempts, and an access log provides all of the details on requests for specific files on a system. **Monitoring system logs can determine how an attack occurred and whether the defenses deployed were successful**. With the increase in the sheer number of log files generated for computer security purposes, **the organization should consider a log management process**. Log management determines the process for generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of computer security log data.

* **Operating System Logs**: Operating system logs record events that occur because of operational actions performed by the operating system. System events include the following:

* Client requests and server responses such as successful user authentications
* Usage information that contains the number and size of transactions in a given period of time

* **Security Application Logs**: Organizations use network-based or system-based security software to detect malicious activity. This software generates a security log to provide computer security data. Logs are useful for performing auditing analysis and identifying trends and long-term problems. Logs also enable an organization to provide documentation showing that it is in compliance with laws and regulatory requirements.

## Power

A critical issue in protecting information systems is electrical power systems and power considerations. **A continuous supply of electrical power is critical in today's massive server and data storage facilities**. Here are some general rules in building effective electrical supply systems:

* Data centers should be on a different power supply from the rest of the building
* Redundant power sources: two or more feeds coming from two or more electrical substations
* Power conditioning
* Backup power systems are often required
* UPS should be available to gracefully shutdown systems

An organization must protect itself from several issues when designing its electrical power supply systems.

Power Excess
* Spike: momentary high voltage
* Surge: prolonged high voltage

Power Loss
* Fault: momentary loss of power
* Blackout: complete loss of power

Power Degradation
* Sag/dip: momentary low voltage
* Brownout: prolonged low voltage
* Inrush Current: initial surge of power

## Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)

HVAC systems are critical to the safety of people and information systems in the organization's facilities. When designing modern IT facilities, **these systems play a very important role in the overall security**. **HVAC systems control the ambient environment (temperature, humidity, airflow, and air filtering) and must be planned for and operated along with other data center components such as computing hardware, cabling, data storage, fire protection, physical security systems and power**. Almost all physical computer hardware devices come with environmental requirements that include acceptable temperature and humidity ranges. Environmental requirements appear in a product specifications document or in a physical planning guide. It is critical to maintain these environmental requirements to prevent system failures and extend the life of IT systems. Commercial HVAC systems and other building management systems now connect to the Internet for remote monitoring and control. Recent events have shown such systems (often called "smart systems") also raise big security implications.

One of the risks associated with smart systems is that the individuals who access and manage the system work for a contractor or a third-party vendor. Because HVAC technicians need to be able to find information quickly, crucial data tends to be stored in many different places, making it accessible to even more people. Such a situation allows a wide network of individuals, including even associates of contractors, to gain access to the credentials for an HVAC system. The interruption of these systems can pose considerable risk to the organization's information security.

## Hardware Monitoring

Hardware monitoring is often found in large server farms. A server farm is a facility that houses hundreds or thousands of servers for companies. Google has many server farms around the world to provide optimal services. Even smaller companies are building local server farms to house the growing number of servers need to conduct business. Hardware monitoring systems are used to monitor the health of these systems and to minimize server and application downtime. Modern hardware monitoring systems use USB and network ports to transmit the condition of CPU temperature, power supply status, fan speed and temperature, memory status, disk space and network card status. Hardware monitoring systems enable a technician to monitor hundreds or thousands of systems from a single terminal. As the number of server farms continues to grow, hardware-monitoring systems have become an essential security countermeasure.

## Operation Centers

**The Network Operation Center (NOC)** is one or more locations containing the tools that provide administrators with a detailed status of the organization’s network. **The NOC is ground zero for network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, software distribution and updates, communications management, and device management**.

**The Security Operation Center (SOC) is a dedicated site that monitors, assesses, and defends the organization’s information systems such as websites, applications, databases, data centers, networks, servers, and user systems**. **A SOC is a team of security analysts who detect, analyze, respond to, report on, and prevent cybersecurity incidents**.

**Both of these entities use a hierarchical tier structure to handle events**. The first tier handles all events and escalates any event that it cannot handle to the second tier. Tier 2 staff reviews the event in detail to try to resolve it. If they cannot, they escalate the event to Tier 3, the subject matter experts.

To measure the overall effectiveness of an operation center, an organization will conduct realistic drills and exercises. A tabletop simulation exercise is a structured walk-through by a team to simulate an event and evaluate the center’s effectiveness. A more effective measure is to simulate a full-fledged intrusion with no warning. This involves using a Red Team, an independent group of individuals who challenges processes within an organization, to evaluate the organization’s effectiveness. For example, the Red Team should attack a critical mission system and include reconnaissance and attack, privilege escalation, and remote access.

## Switches, Routers, and Network Appliances

The following sections discuss several measures that an administrator can take to protect various network devices.

* **Switches**: Network switches are the heart of the modern data communication network. The main threat to network switches are theft, hacking and remote access, attacks against network protocols like ARP/STP or attacks against performance and availability. Several countermeasures and controls can protect network switches including improved physical security, advanced configuration, and implementing proper system updates and patches as needed. Another effective control is the implementation of port security. An administrator should secure all switch ports (interfaces) before deploying the switch for production use. One way to secure ports is by implementing a feature called port security. Port security limits the number of valid MAC addresses allowed on a port. The switch allows access to devices with legitimate MAC addresses while it denies other MAC addresses.
* **VLANs**: VLANs provide a way to group devices within a LAN and on individual switches. VLANs use logical connections instead of physical connections. Individual ports of a switch can be assigned to a specific VLAN. Other ports can be used to physically interconnect switches and allow multiple VLAN traffic between switches. These ports are called trunks. For example, the HR department may need to protect sensitive data. VLANs allow an administrator to segment networks based on factors such as function, project team, or application, without regard for the physical location of the user or device as shown in Figure 1. Devices within a VLAN act as if they are in their own independent network, even if they share a common infrastructure with other VLANs. A VLAN can separate groups that have sensitive data from the rest of the network, decreasing the chances of confidential information breaches. Trunks allow individuals on the HR VLAN to be physically connected to multiple switches. There are many different types of VLAN vulnerabilities and attacks. These can include attacking the VLAN and Trucking protocols. These attack details are beyond the scope of this course. Hackers can also attack VLAN performance and availability. Common countermeasures include monitoring VLAN changes and performance, advanced configurations and regular system patching and updates to the IOS.
* **Firewalls**: Firewalls are hardware or software solutionsWireless and Mobile Devicesor deny statements that apply to addresses or protocols. ACLs provide a powerful way to control traffic into and out of a network. Firewalls keep attacks out of a private network and are a common target of hackers in order to defeat the firewall protections. The main threat to firewalls are theft, hacking and remote access, attacks against ACLs or attacks against performance and availability. Several countermeasures and controls can protect firewalls including improved physical security, advanced configuration, secure remote access and authentication, and proper system updates and patches as needed.
* **Routers**: Routers form the backbone of the Internet and communications between different networks. Routers communicate with one another to identify the best possible path to deliver traffic to different networks. Routers use routing protocols to make routing decision. Routers can also integrate other services like switching and firewall capabilities. These operations make routers prime targets. The main threat to network routers are theft, hacking and remote access, attacks against routing protocols like RIP/OSPF or attacks against performance and availability. Several countermeasures and controls can protect network routers including improved physical security, advanced configuration settings, use of secure routing protocols with authentication, and proper system updates and patches as needed.

### Wireless and Mobile Devices

Wireless and mobile devices have become the predominant type of devices on most modern networks. They provide mobility and convenience but pose a host of vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include theft, hacking and unauthorized remote access, sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and attacks against performance and availability. The best way to secure a wireless network is to use authentication and encryption. The original wireless standard, 801.11, introduced two types of authentication as shown in the figure:

* Open system authentication - Any wireless device can connect to the wireless network. Use this method in situations where security is of no concern.
* Shared key authentication - Provides mechanisms to authenticate and encrypt data between a wireless client and AP or wireless router.

The three shared key authentication techniques for WLANs are as follows:

* Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) - This was the original 802.11 specification securing WLANs. However, the encryption key never changes when exchanging packets, making it easy to hack.
* Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) - This standard uses WEP, but secures the data with the much stronger Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) encryption algorithm. TKIP changes the key for each packet, making it much more difficult to hack.
* IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 - IEEE 802.11i is now the industry standard for securing WLANs. 802.11i and WPA2 both use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption, which is currently the strongest encryption protocol.

Since 2006, any device that bears the Wi-Fi Certified logo is WPA2 certified. Therefore, modern WLANs should always use the 802.11i/WPA2 standard. Other countermeasure include improved physical security and regular system updates and patching of devices.

### Network and Routing Services

Cyber criminals use vulnerable network services to attack a device or to use it as part of the attack. To check for insecure network services, review a device for open ports using a port scanner. A port scanner is an application that probes a device for open ports by sending a message to each port and waiting for a response. The response indicates how the port is used. Cyber criminals will also use port scanners for the same reason. Securing network services ensures that only necessary ports are exposed and available.

* **Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)**: DHCP uses a server to assign an IP address and other configuration information automatically to network devices. In effect, the device is getting a permission slip from the DHCP server to use the network. Attackers can target DHCP servers in order to deny access to devices on the network. Figure 1 provides a security checklist for DHCP.

* **Domain Name System (DNS)**: DNS resolves a Uniform Resource Locator URL or website address (http://www.cisco.com) to the IP address of the site. When users type a web address into the address bar they depend on DNS servers to resolve the actual IP address of that destination. Attackers can target DNS servers in order to deny access to network resources or redirect traffic to rogue websites. Click on Figure 2 to view a security checklist for DNS. Use secure service and authentication between DNS servers to protect them from these attacks.

* **Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP)**: Network devices use ICMP to send error messages like a requested service is not available or that the host could not reach the router. The ping command is a network utility that uses ICMP to test the reachability of a host on a network. Ping sends ICMP messages to the host and waits for a reply. Cyber criminals can alter the use of ICMP for the evil purposes listed in Figure 3. Denial-of-Service attacks use ICMP, so many networks filter certain ICMP requests to prevent such attacks.

* **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: RIP limits the number of hops allowed in a path on a network from the source device to the destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is fifteen. RIP is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information about which networks each router can reach and how far away those networks are. RIP calculates the best route based on hop count. Figure 4 lists RIP vulnerabilities and defenses against RIP attack. Hackers can target routers and the RIP protocol. Attacks on routing services can effect performance and availability. Some attacks can even result in traffic redirection. Use secure services with authentication and implement system patching and updates to protect routing services such as RIP.

* **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**: Having the correct time within networks is important. Correct time stamps accurately track network events such as security violations. Additionally, clock synchronization is critical for the correct interpretation of events within syslog data files as well as for digital certificates. Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol that synchronizes the clocks of computer systems over data networks. NTP allows network devices to synchronize their time settings with an NTP server. Figure 5 lists the various methods used to provide secure clocking for the network. Cyber criminals attack timeservers to disrupt secure communication that depends on digital certificates and to hide attack information like accurate time stamps.

* DHCP Secuirty Checklist
  * Physically secure the DHCP server
  * Apply any software patches
  * Locate the DHCP server behind a firewall
  * Monitor DHCP activity by reviewing DHCP logs
  * Maintain a strong antivirus solution
  * Uninstall any unused services and applications
  * Close unused ports

### VoIP Equipment

Voice over IP (VoIP) uses networks such as the Internet to make and receive phone calls. The equipment required for VoIP includes an Internet connection plus a phone. Several options are available for the phone set:

* A traditional phone with an adapter (the adapter acts as a hardware interface between a traditional, analog phone and a digital VoIP line)
* A VoIP-enabled phone
* VoIP software installed on a computer

Most consumer VoIP services use the Internet for phone calls. Many organizations, though, use their private networks because they provide stronger security and service quality. VoIP security is only as reliable as the underlying network security. Cyber criminals target these systems in order to gain access to free phone services, eavesdrop on phone calls, or to affect performance and availability.

Implement the following countermeasures to secure VoIP:
* Encrypt voice message packets to protect against eavesdropping.
* Use SSH to protect gateways and switches.
* Change all default passwords.
* Use an intrusion detection system to detect attacks such as ARP poisoning.
* Use strong authentication to mitigate registration spoofing (cyber criminals route all incoming calls for the victim to them), proxy impersonating (tricks the victim into communicating with a rogue proxy set up by the cyber criminals), and call hijacking (the call is intercepted and rerouted to a different path before reaching the destination).
* Implement firewalls that recognize VoIP to monitor streams and filter abnormal signals.

When the network goes down, voice communications will also go down.

## Cameras

* Cybersecurity best practices for security camera systems
  * Use strong camera passwords
  * do not connect unprotected servers that provide remote access
  * implement a firewall to protect devices providing remote access
  * place the security camera on a physically separate network
  * Track and monitor any operation system vulnerability and apply required patches
  * Set a strong password for the operating system
  * Select only vendors who encrypt their connections
  * Encrypt video in-trasit and at-rest
  * Use the same precautions for mobile access
  * Secure physical access to equipment

## Videoconferencing Equipment

Videoconferencing allows two or more locations to communicate simultaneously using telecommunication technologies. These technologies take advantage of the new high definition video standards. Products like Cisco TelePresence enable a group of people in one location to conference with a group of people from other locations in real time. Videoconferencing is now part of normal day-to-day operations in industries like the medical field. Doctors can review patient symptoms and consult with experts to identify potential treatments.

Many local pharmacies employ physician assistants that can link live to doctors using videoconferencing to schedule visits or emergency responses. Many manufacturing organizations are using teleconferencing to help engineers and technicians perform complex operations or maintenance tasks. Videoconferencing equipment can be extremely expensive and are high value targets for thieves and cyber criminals. Click here to watch a video demonstrating the power of videoconferencing systems. Cyber criminals target these systems in order to eavesdrop on video calls or to affect performance and availability.

## Network and IoT Sensors

One of the fastest sectors of information technology is the use of intelligent devices and sensors. The computer industry brands this sector as the Internet of Things (IoT). Businesses and consumers use IoT devices to automate processes, monitor environmental conditions, and alert the user of adverse conditions. Most IoT devices connect to a network via wireless technology and include cameras, door locks, proximity sensors, lights, and other types of sensors used to collect information about an environment or the status of a device. Several appliance manufacturers use IoT to inform users that parts need replacement, components are failing, or supplies are running out.

Businesses use these devices to track inventory, vehicles, and personnel. IoT devices contain geospatial sensors. A user can globally locate, monitor, and control environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and lighting. The IoT industry poses a tremendous challenge to information security professionals because many IoT devices capture and transmit sensitive information. Cyber criminals target these systems in order to intercept data or to affect performance and availability.

## Fencing and Barricades

Physical barriers are the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about physical security. This is the outermost layer of security, and these solutions are the most publicly visible. A perimeter security system typically consists of the following components:

* Perimeter fence system
* Security gate system
* Bollards (a short post used to protect from vehicle intrusions as shown in Figure 2)
* Vehicle entry barriers
* Guard shelters

A fence is a barrier that encloses secure areas and designates property boundaries. All barriers should meet specific design requirements and fabric specifications. High-security areas often require a "top guard" such as barbed wire or concertina wire. When designing the perimeter, fencing systems use the following rules:

* 1 meter (3-4 ft.) will only deter casual trespassers
* 2 meters (6-7 ft.) are too high to climb by casual trespassers
* 2.5 meters (8 ft.) will offer limited delay to a determined intruder

Top guards provide an added deterrent and can delay the intruder by severely cutting the intruder; however, attackers can use a blanket or mattress to alleviate this threat. Local regulations may restrict the type of fencing system an organization can use.

Fences require regular maintenance. Animals may burrow under the fence or the earth may wash out leaving the fence unstable providing easy access for an intruder. Inspect fencing systems regularly. Do not park any vehicles near fences. A parked vehicle near the fence can assist the intruder climbing over or damaging the fence. Click here for additional fencing recommendations.

## Biometrics

Biometrics describes the automated methods of recognizing an individual based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic. Biometric authentication systems include measurements of the face, fingerprint, hand geometry, iris, retina, signature, and voice. Biometric technologies can be the foundation of highly secure identification and personal verification solutions. The popularity and use of biometric systems has increased because of the increased number of security breaches and transaction fraud. Biometrics provides confidential financial transactions and personal data privacy. For example, Apple uses fingerprint technology with its smartphones. The user’s fingerprint unlocks the device and accesses various apps such as online banking or payment apps.

When comparing biometric systems there are several important factors to consider including accuracy, speed or throughput rate, acceptability to users, uniqueness of the biometric organ and action, resistance to counterfeiting, reliability, data storage requirements, enrollment time, and intrusiveness of the scan. The most important factor is accuracy. Accuracy is expressed in error types and rates.

The first error rate is Type I Errors or false rejections. A Type I Error rejects a person that registers and is an authorized user. In access control, if the requirement is to keep the bad guys out, false rejection is the least important error. However, in many biometric applications, false rejections can have a very negative impact on business. For example, bank or retail store needs to authenticate customer identity and account balance. False rejection means that the transaction or sale is lost, and the customer becomes upset. Most bankers and retailers are willing to allow a few false accepts as long as there are minimal false rejects.

The acceptance rate is stated as a percentage and is the rate at which a system accepts unenrolled individuals or imposters as authentic users. False acceptance is a Type II error. Type II errors allow the bad guys in so they are normally considered to be the most important error for a biometric access control system.

The most widely used method to measure the accuracy of biometric authentication is the Crossover Error Rate (CER). The CER is the rate where false rejection rate and the false acceptance rate are equal.

## Badges and Access Logs

An access badge allows an individual to gain access to an area with automated entry points. An entry point can be a door, a turnstile, a gate, or other barrier. Access badges use various technologies such as a magnetic stripe, barcode, or biometrics.

A card reader reads a number contained on the access badge. The system sends the number to a computer that makes access control decisions based on the credential provided. The system logs the transaction for later retrieval. Reports reveal who entered what entry points at what time.

## Guards and Escorts

All physical access controls including deterrent and detection systems ultimately rely on personnel to intervene and stop the actual attack or intrusion. In highly secure information system facilities, guards control access to the organization’s sensitive areas. The benefit of using guards is that they can adapt more than automated systems. Guards can learn and distinguish many different conditions and situations and make decisions on the spot. Security guards are the best solution for access control when the situation requires an instantaneous and appropriate response. However, guards are not always the best solution. There are numerous disadvantages to using security guards including cost and the ability to monitor and record high volume traffic. The use of guards also introduces human error to the mix.

##  Video and Electronic Surveillance

Video and electronic surveillance supplement or in some cases, replace security guards. The benefit of video and electronic surveillance is the ability to monitor areas even when no guards or personnel are present, the ability to record and log surveillance videos and data for long periods, and the ability to incorporate motion detection and notification.

Video and electronic surveillance can also be more accurate in capturing events even after they occur. Another major advantage is that video and electronic surveillance provide points of view not easily achieved with guards. It can also be far more economical to use cameras to monitor the entire perimeter of a facility. In a highly secure environment, an organization should place video and electronic surveillance at all entrances, exits, loading bays, stairwells and refuse collection areas. In most cases, video and electronic surveillance supplement security guards.

## RFID and Wireless Surveillance

Managing and locating important information system assets are a key challenge for most organizations. Growth in the number of mobile devices and IoT devices has made this job even more difficult. Time spent searching for critical equipment can lead to expensive delays or downtime. The use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) asset tags can be of great value to the security staff. An organization can place RFID readers in the door frames of secure areas so that they are not visible to individuals.

The benefit of RFID asset tags is that they can track any asset that physically leaves a secure area. New RFID asset tag systems can read multiple tags simultaneously. RFID systems do not require line-of-sight to scan tags. Another advantage of RFID is the ability to read tags that are not visible. Unlike barcodes and human readable tags that must be physically located and viewable to read, RFID tags do not need to be visible to scan. For example, tagging a PC up under a desk would require personnel to crawl under the desk to physically locate and view the tag when using a manual or barcode process. Using an RFID tag would allow personnel to scan the tag without even seeing it.
