# 2.0 The Cybersecurity Cube: summary

**Cybersecurity professionals are best described as experts charged with the protection of  cyberspace.** To do that, many tools have been developed to support that activity. One of them is the cybersecurity cube. This is used as tool when managing the **protection of networks, domains and the Internet**.

**The cube has three dimensions**:

1. security principles (it is known as CIA triad)
  * confidentiality
  * integrity
  * availability
2. Information states
  * transmission
  * storage
  * processing
3. countermeasures
  * technology
  * policies and practice
  * people

**The principles of security**

**The first dimension of the cybersecurity cube identifies the goals to protect cyberspace. The goals identified in the first dimension are the foundational principles**. They are important because they provide focus and enable cybersecurity expert to prioritize actions when protecting any networked system.

* **Confidentiality**: prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people, resources, or processes. 
* **Integrity**: refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. 
* **Availability**: ensures that information is accessible by authorized users when needed. Use the acronym CIA to remember these three principles.

**The states of data**

**The cyberspace is the space of information, which means, data. Therefore, cybersecurity experts focus on protecting data.** The second dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube focuses on the problems of protecting all of the states of data in cyberspace. Data has three possible states:

* Data in transit
* Data at rest or in storage
* Data in process

The protection of cyberspace requires cybersecurity professionals to account for the safeguarding of data in all three states.

**Cybersecurity Safeguards**

**The third dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube defines the skills and discipline a cybersecurity professional can call upon to protect cyberspace. Cybersecurity professionals have a reputation for mastering the technological tools at their disposal. However, McCumber reminds them that the technological tools are not enough to defeat cyber criminals.**
**Cybersecurity professionals must also build a strong defense by establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines that enable the users of cyberspace to stay safe and follow good practices**. Finally, **users of cyberspace must strive to become more knowledgeable about the threats of the cyberspace and establish a culture of learning and awareness**.

## security principle

### the Principle of Confidentiality

**Confidentiality prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people**, **resources and processes**. **Another term for confidentiality is privacy**. Organizations restrict access to ensure that only authorized operators can use data or other network resources. Organizations need to train employees about best practices in safeguarding sensitive information to protect themselves and the organization from attacks. Methods used to ensure confidentiality include data encryption, authentication, and access control.

#### Protecting Data Privacy

In this field, the caution is on sensitive information, which means data protected from unauthorized access to safeguard an individual or an organization. There are three types of sensitive information:

* **Personal information is personally identifiable information (PII)** that traces back to an individual.
* **Business information is information that includes anything that poses a risk to the organization** if discovered by the public or a competitor.
* **Classified information is information belonging to a government body** classified by its level of sensitivity.

#### Controlling Access 

Access control defines a number of **protection schemes that prevent unauthorized access** to a computer, network, database, or other data resources. The **concepts of AAA** involve three security services**: **Authentication**, **Authorization** and **Accounting**. These services 

provide the primary framework to control access.

* **Authentication**: verifies the identity of a user to prevent unauthorized access. Users prove their identity with a username or ID. In addition, users need to verify their identity by providing one of the following: **Something they know** (such as a password), **Something they have** (such as a token or card), **Something they are** (such a fingerprint). Multifactor authentication requires more than one type of authentication. 
* **Authorization**: services determine which resources users can access**, along with the operations that users can perform. Some systems accomplish this by using an access control list, or an ACL. An ACL determines whether a user has certain access privileges once the user authenticates. Just because you can log onto the corporate network does not mean that you have permission to use the high-speed color printer. **Authorization can also control when a user has access to a specific resource**.
* **Accounting** keeps track of what users do, including what they access, the amount of time they access resources, and any changes made. An audit of that system can reveal the time and amount of all transactions and the employee or system that executed the transactions. Cybersecurity accounting services work the same way. The system tracks each data transaction and provides auditing results.

#### Laws and Liability

Confidentiality and privacy **seem interchangeable**, but from a legal standpoint, **they mean different things**. Most privacy data is confidential, but not all confidential data is private. Access to confidential information occurs after confirming proper authorization. Financial institutions, hospitals, medical professionals, law firms, and businesses handle confidential information. Confidential information has a non-public status. Maintaining confidentiality is more of an ethical duty. **Privacy is the appropriate use of data**. When organizations collect information provided by customers or employees, **they should only use that data for its intended purpose**. Most organizations will require the customer or employee to sign a release form giving the organization permission to use the data.

The growing number of privacy related statutes create a tremendous burden on organizations that collect and analyze data. **Policies are the best way for an organization to comply with the growing number of privacy related laws**. Policies enable organizations to **enforce specific rules, procedures, and processes** when collecting, storing, and sharing data.

### the Principle of integrity

Integrity is the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data during its entire life cycle. **Another term for integrity is quality**. Data undergoes a number of operations such as capture, storage, retrieval, update, and transfer, **and through all this the data must remain unaltered during all of these operations by unauthorized entities**. Methods used to ensure data integrity include hashing, data validation checks, data consistency checks, and access controls. Data integrity systems can include one or more of the methods listed above.

**Data integrity is a fundamental component of information security and the need for data integrity varies based on how an organization uses data.**

* Examples:
  * FB does not verify the data that a user posts in a profile;
  * A bank or financial organization assigns a higher importance to data integrity than FB does;
    * Transactions and customer accounts must be accurate.
  * In a healthcare organization, data integrity might be a matter of life or death.
    * Prescription information must be accurate.


**Data integrity levels:**
 * Critical Level
    * Healthcare and emergency services:
      * all data is validated and tested
      * data is verified to provide trustworthiness
      * examples include healthcare and financial records
  * High Level
    * Ecommerce and analytics
      * all data is validated
      * data is checked to provide trustworthiness
      * examples include organizations' databases
  * Mid Level
    * online sales and search engines:
      * little verification is performed
      * data not completely trustworthy
      * data is collected with publicly posted forms
  * Low Level
    * blogs and personal posting sites
      * data may not be verified
      * low level of trust in content
      * examples include public opinion and open contribution


Protecting data integrity is a constant challenge for most organizations because loss of data integrity can render entire data resources unreliable or unusable.

#### integrity check

Integrity check is a way to measure the consistency of a collection of data. The integrity check performs a process called a hash function to take a snapshot of data at an instant in time. The integrity check uses the snapshot to ensure data remains unchanged.

**Checksum**: It is a example of a hash function. A checksum verifies the integrity of files, or strings of characters, before and after they transfer from one device to another across a local network or the Internet. Checksums simply convert each piece of information to a value and sum the total. To test the data integrity, a receiving system just repeats the process. If the two sums are equal, the data is valid. If they are not equal, a change occurred somewhere along the line.

**Hash functions**: Common hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512, which are complex mathematical algorithms.

**Version control**: Organizations use version control to prevent accidental changes by authorized users. Two users cannot update the same object. Objects can be files, database records, or transactions. 

**Backups**: Accurate backups help to maintain data integrity if data becomes corrupted. An organization needs to verify its backup process to ensure the integrity of the backup before data loss occurs.

**Authorization**: Authorization determines who has access to an organization’s resources based on their need to know.


### the Principle of availability

Data availability is the **principle used to describe the need to maintain availability of information systems and services at all times**. Cyberattacks and system failures can prevent access to information systems and services. For example, interrupting the availability of the website of a competitor by bringing it down may provide an advantage to its rival. These denial-of-service (DoS) attacks threaten system availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing and using information systems when needed.

Methods used to ensure availability include **system redundancy**, **system backups**, **increased system resiliency**, **equipment maintenance**, **up-to-date operating systems** and **software**, and **plans in place to recover quickly from unforeseen disasters**.

#### five nines

**The continuous availability of information systems is imperative to modern life**. The term high availability, describes systems designed to avoid downtime. High availability ensures a level of performance for a higher than normal period. High availability systems typically include three design principles.

* **Eliminate single points of failure**: identify all devices and components in a system that would result in a system failure if that device or component fails. Methods to eliminate single points of failure include hot stand-by devices, redundant components, and multiple connections or pathways.
* **Provide for reliable crossover**: redundant power supplies, backup power systems and backup communications systems all provide for reliable crossover.
* **Detect failures as they occur**: active device and systems monitoring detects many types of events including system and device failures. Monitoring systems may even trigger the backup system in the case of a failure.

Those three principles have the goal to continue to operate under extreme conditions. One of the most popular high availability practices is five nines. The five nines refer to 99.999%. This means that downtime is less than 5.26 minutes per year. Figure 2 provides three approaches to five nines.

#### Ensuring Availability

1. Equipment maintenance: regular equipment maintenance can dramatically improve system uptime. Maintenance includes component replacement, cleaning and alignment.
2. OS updates: modern operating systems, applications, and software programs are continuously updated to correct errors and eliminate vulnerabilities. All systems, applications and software should be updated on a regular schedule. Cybersecurity professionals can subscribe to alerts that announce new update releases.
3. Backup systems: backup of organization data, configuration data and personal data ensures system availability. Backup systems should also be tested to ensure these systems work properly and that data can be recovered in the event of data loss.
4. Plan for disasters: disaster planning is a critical part of increasing system availability. Employees and customers should know how to respond to a disaster. The cybersecurity team should practice response and test backup systems and be familiar with procedures for restoring critical systems.
5. Implement technologies: high availability requires continuous evaluation and testing new technologies to counter new threats and attacks. Cyber criminals use the latest tools and tricks. Cyber professionals are also required to use new technologies, products and devices.
6. monitor systems: continuous system monitoring increases system availability. Monitoring event logs, system alerts and access logs provides the cybersecurity professional with real-time system information. This information can identify attacks after the event occurs and enable the cybersecurity professional to fend off attacks as they occur.
7. System testing: all systems should be tested to find vulnerabilities. Testing can include port scans, vulnerability scans and penetration tests.



## state of data

### data at rest

Data at rest means that a type of storage device retains the data when no user or process is using it. A storage device can be local (on a computing device) or centralized (on the network). A number of options exist for storing data.

**Direct-attached storage (DAS)**: it is storage connected to a computer. A hard drive or USB flash drive is an example of direct-attached storage. By default, systems are not set up to share direct-attached storage.

**Redundant array of independent disks (RAID)**: it uses multiple hard drives in an array, which is a method of combining multiple disks so that the operating system sees them as a single disk. RAID provides improved performance and fault tolerance.

**A network attached storage (NAS)**: this device is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a centralized location by authorized network users. NAS devices are flexible and scalable, meaning administrators can increase the capacity as needed.

**A storage area network (SAN)**: this architecture is a network based storage system. SAN systems connect to the network using high-speed interfaces allowing improved performance and the ability to connect multiple servers to a centralized disk storage repository.

**Cloud storage**: it is a remote storage option that uses space on a data center provider and is accessible from any computer with Internet access. Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox are all examples of cloud storage providers.

#### Challenges of Protecting Stored Data

Organizations have a challenging task in trying to protect stored data. In order to improve data storage, organizations can automate and centralize data backups.

Direct-attached storage can be one of the most difficult types of data storage to manage and control. Direct-attached storage is vulnerable to malicious attacks on the local host. Stored data may also include backup data. Backups can be manual or automatic. Organizations should limit the types of data stored on direct-attached storage. In particular, an organization would not store critical data on direct-attached storage devices.

Network storage systems offer a more secure option. Network storage systems including RAID, SAN and NAS provide greater performance and redundancy. However, network storage systems are more complicated to configure and manage. They also handle more data, posing a greater risk to the organization if the device fails. The unique challenges of network storage systems include configuring, testing, and monitoring the system.



### data in-transit

In a simples way, data transmission involves sending information from one device to another. There are numerous methods to transmit information between devices including:

* Sneaker net: uses removable media to physically move data from one computer to another
* Wired networks: uses cables to transmit data
* Wireless networks: uses radio waves to transmit data

**Organizations will never be able to eliminate the use of a sneaker net**. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of transmitted data is one of the most important responsibilities of a cybersecurity professional.

#### Challenges of Protecting Data In-Transit

**The protection of transmitted data is one of the most challenging jobs of a cybersecurity professional**. With the growth in mobile and wireless devices, cybersecurity professionals are responsible for protecting massive amounts of data crossing their network on a daily basis. The cybersecurity professional must deal with several challenges in protecting this data:

* **Protecting data confidentiality**: cyber criminals can capture, save and steal data in-transit. Cyber professionals must take steps to counter these actions.
* **Protecting data integrity**: cyber criminals can intercept and alter data in-transit. Cybersecurity professionals deploy data integrity systems that test the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data to counter these actions.
* **Protecting data availability**: cyber criminals can use rogue or unauthorized devices to interrupt data availability. A simple mobile device can pose as a local wireless access point and trick unsuspecting users into associating with the rogue device. The cybercriminal can hi-jack an authorized connection to a protected service or device. Network security professionals can implement mutual-authentication systems to counter these actions. Mutual-authentication systems require the user to authenticate to the server, and requests the server to authenticate to the user.

Some countermeasures include: VPNs, SSL, IPsec, Encryption/Decryption, Hashing, Redundancy, Hot Standby.

### data in process

This refers to data during initial input, modification, computation, or output. Protection of data integrity starts with the initial input of data. Organizations use several methods to collect data, such as manual data entry, scanning forms, file uploads, and data collected from sensors. Each of these methods pose potential threats to data integrity. An example of data corruption during the input process includes data entry errors or disconnected, malfunctioning, or inoperable system sensors. Other examples can include mislabeling and incorrect or mismatched data formats.

Data modification refers to any changes to the original data such as users manually modifying data, programs processing and changing data, and equipment failing resulting in data modification. Processes like encoding/decoding, compression/decompression and encryption/decryption are all examples of data modification. Malicious code also results in data corruption.

Data corruption also occurs during the data output process. Data output refers to outputting data to printers, electronic displays or directly to other devices. The accuracy of output data is critical because output provides information and influences decision-making. Examples of output data corruption include the incorrect use of data delimiters, incorrect communication configurations, and improperly configured printers.

#### Challenges of Protecting Data In-Process

Protecting against invalid data modification during processing can have an adverse impact. Software errors are the reason for many mishaps and disasters. For example, just two weeks before Christmas, some of Amazon’s third-party retailers experienced a change in the advertised price on their items to just one cent. The glitch lasted for one hour. The error resulted in thousands of shoppers getting the deal of a lifetime and the company losing revenue. In 2016, the Nest thermostat malfunctioned and left users with no heat. The Nest thermostat is a smart technology owned by Google. A software glitch left users, literally, out in the cold. A software update went wrong, forcing the device’s batteries to drain and leaving it unable to control temperature. As a result, customers were unable to heat their homes or get hot water on one of the coldest weekends of the year. 

Some countermeasures are access control, data validation, data duplication.

## countermeasures

### Technologies

#### Software-based Technology Safeguards

Software safeguards include programs and services that protect operating systems, databases, and other services operating on workstations, portable devices, and servers. Administrators install software-based countermeasures or safeguards on individual hosts or servers. There are several software-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets:

* Software firewalls control remote access to a system. Operating systems typically include a firewall or a user can purchase or download software from a third party.
* Network and port scanners discover and monitor open ports on a host or server.
* Protocol analyzers, or signature analyzers, are devices that collect and examine network traffic. They identify performance problems, detect misconfigurations, identify misbehaving applications, establish baseline and normal traffic patterns, and debug communication problems.
* Vulnerability scanners are computer programs designed to assess weaknesses on computers or networks.
* Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) examine activity on host systems only. An IDS generates log files and alarm messages when it detects unusual activity. A system storing sensitive data or providing critical services is a candidate for host-based IDS.

#### Hardware-based technology safeguards

There are several hardware-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets:

* Firewall appliances block unwanted traffic. Firewalls contain rules that define the traffic allowed into and out of a network.
* Dedicated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network and send an alert.
* Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network, generate an alert and take corrective actions. 
* Content filtering services control access and transmission of objectionable or offensive content.

#### Network-based Technology Safeguards

There are several network-based technologies used to protect the organization’s assets:

* Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure virtual network that uses the public network (i.e., the Internet). The security of a VPN lies in the encryption of packet content between the endpoints that define the VPN.
* Network access control (NAC) requires a set of checks before allowing a device to connect to a network. Some common checks include up-to-data antivirus software or operating system updates installed.
* Wireless access point security includes the implementation of authentication and encryption.

#### Cloud-based Technology Safeguards

Cloud-based technologies shift the technology component from the organization to the cloud provider. The three main cloud computing services include:

* Software as a Service (SaaS) allows users to gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure. Users store data on the cloud provider’s servers.
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. The provider hosts the hardware, software, servers, and storage components.
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.

Cloud service providers have extended these options to include IT as a Service (ITaaS), which provides IT support for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models. In the ITaaS model, an organization contracts with the Cloud provider for individual or bundled services.

Cloud service providers use virtual security appliances that run inside a virtual environment with a pre-packaged, hardened operating system running on virtualized hardware.

### Education, awareness and training

#### Implementing Cybersecurity Education and Training

**Investing a lot of money in technology will not make a difference if the people within the organization are the weakest link in cybersecurity**. A security awareness program is extremely important for an organization. An employee may not be purposefully malicious but just unaware of what the proper procedures are. There are several ways to implement a formal training program:

* Make security awareness training a part of the employee’s onboarding process
* Tie security awareness to job requirements or performance evaluations
* Conduct in-person training sessions
* Complete online courses

Security awareness should be **an ongoing process** since new threats and techniques are always on the horizon.

#### Establishing a Culture of Cybersecurity Awareness

**The members of an organization must be aware of security policies** and have the **knowledge to make security part of their day-to-day activities**. An active security awareness program depends on:

* The organization's environment
* The level of threat

The creation of a cybersecurity awareness culture is **an ongoing effort that requires the leadership of upper management and the commitment of all users and employees**. Affecting the cybersecurity culture of an organization starts with the establishment of policies and procedures by management. For example, many organizations have cybersecurity awareness days. Organizations can also post banners and signage to increase overall cybersecurity awareness. The creation of cybersecurity orientation workshops and seminars help to increase awareness.

#### Cybersecurity from policies to procedures


##### Policies

A security policy is a set of security objectives for a company that includes rules of behavior for users and administrators and specifies system requirements. These objectives, rules, and requirements collectively ensure the security of a network, the data, and the computer systems within an organization.

**A comprehensive security policy accomplishes several tasks:**

* It demonstrates an organization’s commitment to security.
* It sets the rules for expected behavior.
* It ensures consistency in system operations, software and hardware acquisition and use, and maintenance.
* It defines the legal consequences of violations.
* It gives security staff the backing of management.

Security policies inform users, staff, and managers of an organization’s requirements for protecting technology and information assets. A security policy also specifies the mechanisms needed to meet security requirements.

A security policy typically includes:

* **Identification and authentication policies**: specifies authorized persons that can have access to network resources and outlines verification procedures.
* **Password policies**: Ensures passwords meet minimum requirements and are changed regularly.
* **Acceptable use policies**: Identifies network resources and usage that are acceptable to the organization. It may also identify ramifications for policy violations.
* **Remote access policies**: Identifies how remote users can access a network and what is remotely accessible.
* **Network maintenance policies**: Specifies network device operating systems and end user application update procedures.
* **Incident handling policies**: Describes how security incidents are handled.

One of the most common security policy components is an acceptable use policy (AUP). This component defines what users can and cannot do on the various system components. The AUP should be as explicit as possible to avoid misunderstanding. For example, an AUP lists specific websites, newsgroups, or bandwidth intensive applications that users cannot access using company computers or the company network.

##### Standards

Standards help an IT staff **maintain consistency in operating the network**. **Standards documents provide the technologies that specific users or programs need in addition to any program requirements or criteria that an organization must follow**. This helps IT staff improve efficiency and simplicity in design, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

**One of the most important security principles is consistency**. For this reason, **it is necessary for organizations to establish standards**. Each organization develops standards to support its unique operating environment. For example, an organization establishes a password policy. The standard is that passwords require a minimum of eight upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters, including at least one special character. A user must change a password every 30 days, and a password history of 12 previous passwords ensures that the user creates unique passwordsThe figure shows an example of the procedure used to change a password.

Guidelines are **a list of suggestions on how to do things more efficiently and securely**. They are similar to standards, but are more flexible and are not usually mandatory. Guidelines define how standards are developed and guarantee adherence to general security policies.

Some of the **most helpful guidelines make up an organization’s best practices**. In addition to an organization’s defined best practices, guidelines are also available from the following:

* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Resource Center
* National Security Agency (NSA) Security Configuration Guides
* The Common Criteria standard

**Using the password policy example, a guideline is a suggestion that the user take a phrase like "I have a dream" and convert it to a strong password, Ihv@dr3@m. The user can create other passwords from this phrase by changing the number, moving the symbol, or changing the punctuation mark.**

##### Procedures

Procedure documents **are longer and more detailed than standards and guidelines**. Procedure documents **include implementation details** that usually **contain step-by-step instructions and graphics**. Large organizations must use procedure documents to maintain the consistency of deployment that is necessary for a secure environment.

## The ISO Cybersecurity Model

**Security professionals need to secure information from end-to-end within the organization**. This is a monumental task, and it is unreasonable to expect one individual to have all of the requisite knowledge. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) **developed a comprehensive framework to guide information security management**. The ISO/IEC **cybersecurity model is to cybersecurity professionals what the OSI networking model is to network engineers**. Both provide a framework for understanding and approaching complex tasks.

### ISO Cybersecurity domain

ISO publishes the ISO 27000 standards. **Even though the standards are not mandatory, most countries use them as a facto framework for implementing information security**.

The ISO 27000 standards describe the implementation of a comprehensive **information security management system** (ISMS), which means a consistent of all of the administrative, technical and operational controls to keep information safe within an organization. 

**Twelve independent domains represent the components of the ISO 27000 standard**. These twelve domains serve to organize, at a high level, the vast areas of information under the umbrella of information security.

The structure of the ISO cybersecurity model is different from the OSI model in that it uses domains rather than layers to describe the categories for security. The reason for this is that the **ISO cybersecurity model is not a hierarchical relationship**. It is a peer model in which each domain has a direct relationship with the other domains. The ISO 27000 cybersecurity model is very similar to the OSI model in that it is vital for cybersecurity specialists to understand both of these models to be successful.

**The twelve domains serve as a common basis for developing organizational security standards and effective security management practices. They also help to facilitate communication between organizations.**

1. **Risk assessment**: this is the first step in the risk management process. It determines the **quantitative and qualitative value of risk** **related to a specific situation or recognized threat**.
2. **Security Policy**: a document that addresses the **constraints and behaviors of members of an organization** and often **specifies how data can be accessed and what data is accessible by whom**.
3. **Organization of information security**: this is the **governance model set out by an organization for information security**.
4. **Asset management**: this is **an inventory of and classification scheme for information assets**.
5. **Human resources security**: this **addresses security procedures relating to employees joining**, **moving within**, and leaving an organization
6. **physical and environmental security**: this describes the **protections of the computer facilities within an organization**.
7. **communications and operations management**: this describes the **management of technical security controls in system and networks**.
8. **information system acquisition, development and maintenance**: the describes the **integration of security into applications**.
9. **access control**: this describes the **restriction of access rights to networks, systems, applications, functions, and data**.
10. **information security incident management**: this describes how to **anticipate and respond to information security breaches**.
11.**business continuity management**: this describes the **protection, maintenance, and recovery of business-critical processes and systems**.
12. **compliance**: this describes the **process of ensuring conformance with information security policies, standards, and regulations**.

#### Control Objectives

The **twelve domains consist of control objectives defined in the** **27001 part of the standard**. The control objectives define the high-level requirements to implement a comprehensive ISM. An organization’s management team uses the ISO 27001 control objectives to define and publish the organization’s security policies. Control objectives provide a checklist to use during security management audits. Many organizations need to pass an ISMS audit in order to earn a designation of ISO 27001 compliant.

**Certification and compliance provide confidence for two organizations that need to trust each other’s confidential data and operations**. Compliance and security audits prove that organizations are continuously improving their information security management system.

The following is an example of a control objective:

To control access to networks by using the appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment.

#### controls

The **ISO/IEC 27002** defines **information security management system controls**. Controls are more detailed than objectives. **Control objectives tell the organization what to do. Controls define how to accomplish the objective**.

Based on the control objective, to control access to networks by using the appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment, the control would be:

**Use strong passwords**. A strong password consists of at least eight characters that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase.

Cybersecurity professionals recognize the following:

* **Controls are not mandatory**, **but they are widely accepted and adopted**.
* Controls must maintain **vendor-neutrality** to avoid the appearance of endorsing a specific product or company.
* **Controls are like guidelines**. This means that there can be more than one way to comply with the objective.


## IT security management framework

### The ISO Cybersecurity Model and the CIA Triad

**The ISO 27000** is a universal framework for every type of organization. In order to use the framework effectively, an organization must narrow down which domains, control objectives, and controls apply to its environment and operations.

**The ISO 27001 control objectives serve as a checklist**. The first step an organization takes is to determine if these control objectives are applicable to the organization. Most organizations generate a document called the **Statement of Applicability (SOA)**. The **SOA defines which control objectives that the organization needs to use**.

**Different organizations place greater priority on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the type of industry**. For example, Google places the highest value on user data confidentiality and availability and less on integrity. Google does not verify user data. Amazon places high emphasis on availability. If the site is not available, Amazon does not make the sale. This does not mean that Amazon ignores confidentiality in favor of availability. Amazon just places a higher priority on availability. Therefore, Amazon may spend more resources ensuring that there are more servers available to handle customer purchases.

An organization tailors its use of the available control objectives and controls to best meet its priorities with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

### The ISO Cybersecurity Model and the States of Data

**Different groups within an organization may be responsible for data in each of the various states.** For example, the **network security group is responsible for data during transmission**. **Programmers and data entry people are responsible for data during processing**. **The hardware and server support specialists are responsible for stored data**. The ISO Controls specifically address security objectives for data in each of the three states.

In this example, representatives from each of the three groups help to identify the controls that are applicable and the priority of each control in their area. The representative from the network security group identifies the controls ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data transmitted.

### The ISO Cybersecurity Model and Safeguards

The ISO 27001 control objectives relate directly to the organization’s cybersecurity policies, procedures and guidelines which upper management determines. The ISO 27002 controls provide technical direction. For example, upper management establishes a policy specifying the protection of all data coming in to or out of the organization. Implementing the technology to meet the policy objectives would not involve upper management. It is the responsibility of IT professionals to properly implement and configure the equipment used to fulfill the policy directives set by upper management.
