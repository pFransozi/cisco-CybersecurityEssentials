# 8 Becoming a Cybersecurity Specialist

## seven domains

### Common User Threats and Vulnerabilities

**The User Domain includes the users who access the organization’s information system.** **Users can be employees, customers, business contractors and other individuals that need access to data**. Users are often the **weakest link in the information security systems** and **pose a significant threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s data**.

Risky or poor user practices often undermine even the best security system. The following are common user threats found in many organizations:

* **No awareness of security**: users must be **aware of sensitive data**, **security policies and procedures**, **technologies and countermeasures provided to protect information and information systems**.
* **Poorly enforced security policies**: all users must be aware of security  policies and consequences of not complying with the organization’s policies.
* **Data theft**: data theft by users can cost organizations financially resulting in damage to an organization’s reputation or posing a legal liability associated with disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Unauthorized downloads**: many network and workstation infections and attacks trace back to users who download unauthorized emails, photos, music, games, apps, programs and videos to workstations, networks, or storage devices.
* **Unauthorized media**: the **use of unauthorized media like CDs, USB drives and network storage devices can result in malware infections and attacks**.
* **Unauthorized VPNs**: **VPNs can hide the theft of unauthorized information**. The encryption normally used to protect confidentiality blinds the IT security staff to data transmission without proper authority.
* **Unauthorized websites**: **accessing unauthorized websites can pose a risk to the user’s data, devices and the organization**. Many websites prompt the visitors to download scripts or plugins that contain malicious code or adware. Some of these sites can take over devices like cameras and applications.
* **Destruction of systems, applications, or data**: **accidental or deliberate destruction or sabotage of systems, application and data pose a great risk to all organizations**. Activists, disgruntled employees and industry competitors can delete data, destroy devices or misconfigure devices to make data and information systems unavailable.

**No technical solution, controls or countermeasures make information systems any more secure than the behaviors and processes of the people who use these systems**.

#### Managing User Threats

Organizations can implement various measures to manage user threats:

* Conduct security awareness training by displaying security awareness posters, inserting reminders in banner greetings, and sending email reminders to employees.
* Educate users annually on policies, staff manuals, and handbook updates.
* Tie security awareness to performance review objectives.
* Enable content filtering and antivirus scanning for email attachments.
* Use content filtering to permit or deny specific domain names in accordance with Acceptable Use Policies (AUP).
* Disable internal CD drives and USB ports.
* Enable automatic antivirus scans for inserted media drives, files, and email attachments.
* Restrict access for users to only those systems, applications, and data needed to perform their job.
* Minimize write/delete permissions to the data owner only.
* Track and monitor abnormal employee behavior, erratic job performance, and use of IT infrastructure during off-hours.
* Implement access control lockout procedures based on AUP monitoring and compliance.
* Enable intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system (IDS/IPS) monitoring for sensitive employee positions and access.

#### Common Threats to the Public Cloud

**The Public Cloud Domain includes services hosted by a cloud provider**, **service provider**, **or Internet provider**. Cloud providers do implement security controls to protect the cloud environment, but organizations are responsible for protecting their resources on the cloud. Three different service models exist from which an organization may choose:

* **Software as a service (SaaS)**: a subscription-based model that provides access to software that is centrally hosted and accessed by users via a web browser.
* **Platform as a service (PaaS)**: provides a platform that allows an organization to develop, run, and manage its applications on the service’s hardware using tools that the service provides.
* **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**: provides virtualized computing resources such as hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components over the Internet.

The following pose a threat to the public cloud:

#### Ethics of a Cybersecurity Specialist



Ethics is the little voice in the background guiding a cybersecurity specialist as to what he should or should not do, regardless of whether it is legal. The organization entrusts the cybersecurity specialist with the most sensitive data and resources. The cybersecurity specialist needs to understand how the law and the organization’s interests help to guide ethical decisions.

Cyber criminals that break into a system, steal credit card numbers, and release a worm are performing unethical actions. How does an organization view the actions of a cybersecurity specialist if they are similar? For example, a cybersecurity specialist may have the opportunity to stop the spread of a worm preemptively by patching it. In effect, the cybersecurity specialist is releasing a worm. This worm is not malicious, though, so does this case get a pass?

The following ethical systems look at ethics from various perspectives.

Utilitarian Ethics

During the 19th century, Jeremy Benthan and John Stuart Mill created Utilitarian Ethics. The guiding principle is that any actions that provide the greatest amount of good over bad or evil are ethical choices.

The Rights Approach

The guiding principle for the Rights Approach is that individuals have the right to make their own choices. This perspective looks at how an action affects the rights of others to judge whether an action is right or wrong. These rights include the right to truth, privacy, safety, and that society applies laws fairly to all members of society.

The Common-Good Approach

The Common-Good Approach proposes that the common good is whatever benefits the community. In this case, a cybersecurity specialist looks at how an action affects the common good of society or the community.

No clear-cut answers provide obvious solutions to the ethical issues that cybersecurity specialists face. The answer as to what is right or wrong can change depending on the situation and the ethical perspective.

#### Computer Ethics Institute

The Computer Ethics Institute is a resource for identifying, assessing, and responding to ethical issues throughout the information technology industry. CEI was one of the first organizations to recognize the ethical and public policy issues arising from the rapid growth of the information technology field. The figure lists the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics created by the Computer Ethics Institute.

* Ten commandments of computer ethics
  1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people
  2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work
  3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files
  4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal
  5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness
  6. Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid
  7. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation
  8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output
  9. Thou shalt thing about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing
  10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that insure consideration and respect for your fellow humans

#### Cybercrime

Laws prohibit undesired behaviors. Unfortunately, the advancements in information system technologies are much greater than the legal system of compromise and lawmaking. A number of laws and regulations affect cyberspace. Several specific laws guide the policies and procedures developed by an organization to ensure that they are in compliance.

Cybercrime

A computer may be involved in a cybercrime in a couple of different ways. There is computer-assisted crime, computer-targeted crime, and computer-incidental crime. Child pornography is an example of computer-incidental crime—the computer is a storage device and is not the actual tool used to commit the crime.

The growth in cybercrime is due to a number of different reasons. There are many tools widely available on the Internet now, and potential users do not need a great deal of expertise to use these tools.

Organizations Created to Fight Cybercrime

There are a number of agencies and organizations out there to aid the fight against cybercrime. Click each of the links in the figure to visit the websites for these organizations to help keep up with the important issues.

#### Civil, Criminal, and Regulatory Cyber Laws

In the United States, there are three primary sources of laws and regulations: statutory law, administrative law, and common law. All three sources involve computer security. The U.S. Congress established federal administrative agencies and a regulatory framework that includes both civil and criminal penalties for failing to follow the rules.

Criminal laws enforce a commonly accepted moral code backed by the authority of the government. Regulations establish rules designed to address consequences in a rapidly changing society enforcing penalties for violating those rules. For example, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is a statutory law. Administratively, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission have been concerned with issues such as intellectual property theft and fraud. Finally, common law cases work their ways through the judicial system providing precedents and constitutional bases for laws.

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

Congress created FISMA in 2002 to change the U.S. government’s approach to information security. As the largest creator and user of information, federal IT systems are high value targets for cyber criminals. FISMA applies to federal agencies’ IT systems and stipulates that agencies create an information security program that includes the following:

    Risk assessments

    Annual inventory of IT systems

    Policies and procedures to reduce risk

    Security awareness training

    Testing and evaluation of all IT system controls

    Incident response procedure

    Continuity of operations plan

#### Industry-Specific Laws

Since World War II, the United States has regulated the export of cryptography due to national security considerations. The Bureau of Industry and Security in the Department of Commerce now controls non-military cryptography exports. There are still export restrictions to rogue states and terrorist organizations.

Countries may decide to restrict the import of cryptography technologies for the following reasons:

    The technology may contain a backdoor or security vulnerability.

    Citizens can anonymously communicate and avoid any monitoring.

    Cryptography may increase levels of privacy above an acceptable level.

#### Security Breach Notification Laws



Businesses are collecting ever-increasing amounts of personal information about their customers, from account passwords and email addresses to highly sensitive medical and financial information. Companies large and small recognize the value of big data and data analytics. This encourages organizations to collect and store information. Cyber criminals are always looking for ways to obtain such information or access and exploit a company’s most sensitive, confidential data. Organizations that collect sensitive data need to be good data custodians. In response to this growth in data collection, several laws require organizations that collect personal information to notify individuals if a breach of their personal data occurs. To see a list of these laws click here.

Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) addresses a myriad of legal privacy issues that resulted from the increasing use of computers and other technology specific to telecommunications. Sections of this law address email, cellular communications, workplace privacy, and a host of other issues related to communicating electronically.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) has been in force for over 20 years. The CFAA provides the foundation for U.S. laws criminalizing unauthorized access to computer systems. The CFAA makes it a crime to knowingly access a computer considered either a government computer or a computer used in interstate commerce, without permission. The CFAA also criminalizes the use of a computer in a crime that is interstate in nature.

The Act criminalizes trafficking in passwords or similar access information, and the act makes it a crime to transmit a program, code, or a command knowingly that results in damage.


#### Protecting Privacy



The U.S. Congress passed CIPA in 2000 to protect children under the age of 17 from exposure to offensive Internet content and obscene material.

Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA)

The Video Privacy Protection Act protects an individual from having the video tapes, DVD’s and games rented disclosed to another party. The statute provides the protections by default, thus requiring a video rental company to obtain the renter’s consent to opt out of the protections if the company wants to disclose personal information about rentals. Many privacy advocates consider VPPA to be the strongest U.S. privacy law.

Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act

The standards mandate safeguards for physical storage, maintenance, transmission, and access to individuals’ health information. HIPAA mandates that organizations that use electronic signatures have to meet standards ensuring information integrity, signer authentication, and nonrepudiation.

California Senate Bill 1386 (SB 1386)

California was the first state to pass a law regarding the notification of the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. Since then, many other states have followed suit. Each of these disclosure notice laws is different, making the case for a unifying federal statute compelling. This act requires that the agencies provide consumers notice of their rights and responsibilities. It mandates that the state notify citizens whenever PII is lost or disclosed. Since the passage of SB 1386, numerous other states have modeled legislation on this bill.

Privacy Policies

Policies are the best way to ensure compliance across an organization, and a privacy policy plays an important role within the organization, especially with the numerous laws enacted to protect privacy. One of the direct outcomes of the legal statutes associated with privacy has been the development of a need for corporate privacy policies associated with data collection.

Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

A privacy impact assessment ensures that personally identifiable information (PII) is properly handled throughout an organization.

    Establish PIA scope.

    Identify key stakeholders.

    Document all contact with PII.

    Review legal and regulatory requirements.

    Document potential issues found when comparing requirements and practices.

    Review findings with key stakeholders.


#### International Laws



With the growth of the Internet and global network connections, unauthorized entry into a computer system, or computer trespass, has emerged as a concern that can have national and international consequences. National laws for computer trespass exist in many countries, but there can always be gaps in how these nations handle this type of crime.

Convention on Cybercrime

The Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on Internet crimes (EU, U.S., Canada, Japan, and others). Common policies handle cybercrime and address the following: copyright infringement, computer-related fraud, child pornography, and violations of network security. Click here to read more about the Convention on Cybercrime.

Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)

EPIC promotes privacy and open government laws and policies globally and focuses on EU-US relations. Click here for the latest news.

#### National Vulnerability Database



The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data that uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). SCAP is a method for using specific standards to automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation. Click here to visit the National Vulnerability Database website.

SCAP uses open standards to enumerate security software flaws and configuration issues. The specifications organize and measure security-related information in standardized ways. The SCAP community is a partnership between the private and public sector to advance the standardization of technical security operations. Click here to visit the Security Content Automation Protocol website.

The NVD uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System to assess the impact of vulnerabilities. An organization can use the scores to rank the severity of vulnerabilities that it finds within its network. This, in turn, can help determine the mitigation strategy.

The site also contains a number of checklists that provide guidance on configuring operating systems and applications to provide a hardened environment. Click here to visit the National Checklist Program Repository.

### Cybersecurty information websites

#### CERT

    Build resilient systems to recover from attacks and failures.

    Enhance mobile security.

    Develop real-time threat sharing.

    Integrate cyber risks with enterprise risk frameworks.

Click here to visit the Advanced Cyber Security Center.

#### 8.2.4.1 Vulnerability Scanners



A vulnerability scanner assesses computers, computer systems, networks, or applications for weaknesses. Vulnerability scanners help to automate security auditing by scanning the network for security risks and producing a prioritized list to address weaknesses. A vulnerability scanner looks for the following types of vulnerabilities:

    Use of default passwords or common passwords

    Missing patches

    Open ports

    Misconfiguration of operating systems and software

    Active IP addresses

When evaluating a vulnerability scanner, look at how it is rated for accuracy, reliability, scalability, and reporting. There are two types of vulnerability scanners to choose from—software-based or cloud-based.

Vulnerability scanning is critical for organizations with networks that include a large number of network segments, routers, firewalls, servers, and other business devices. Click here to see several available options for both commercial and free versions.

#### 8.2.4.2 Penetration Testing

Penetration testing (pen testing) is a method of testing the areas of weaknesses in systems by using various malicious techniques. Pen testing is not the same as vulnerability testing. Vulnerability testing just identifies potential problems. Pen testing involves a cybersecurity specialist that hacks a website, network, or server with the organization’s permission to try to gain access to resources with the knowledge of usernames, passwords, or other normal means. The important differentiation between cyber criminals and cybersecurity specialists is that the cybersecurity specialists have the permission of the organization to conduct the tests.

One of the primary reasons that an organization uses pen testing is to find and fix any vulnerability before the cyber criminals do. Penetration testing is also known as ethical hacking.

#### 8.2.4.3 Packet Analyzers



Packet analyzers (or packet sniffers) intercept and log network traffic. The packet analyzer captures each packet, shows the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content. A sniffer can capture network traffic on both wired and wireless networks. Packet analyzers perform the following functions:

    Network problem analysis

    Detection of network intrusion attempts

    Isolation of exploited system

    Traffic logging

    Detection of network misuse

Click here to see a comparison of packet analyzers: a packet analyzer or sniffer captures data transmitted on a network for legitimate purposes like troubleshooting or illegitimate purposes like compromising data

Kali is an open source Linux security distribution. IT professionals use Kali Linux to test the security of their networks. Kali Linux incorporates more than 300 penetration testing and security auditing programs on a Linux platform. Click here to visit the website.

Network Situational Awareness

An organization needs the ability to monitor networks, analyze the resulting data, and detect malicious activity. Click here for access to a collection of traffic analysis tools developed by CERT.

#### 8.3.1.1 Defining the Roles of Cybersecurity Professionals

The ISO standard defines the role of cybersecurity professionals. The ISO 27000 framework requires:

    A senior manager responsible for IT and ISM (often the audit sponsor)

    Information security professionals

    Security administrators

    Site/physical security manager and facilities contacts

    HR contact for HR matters such as disciplinary action and training

    Systems and network managers, security architects and other IT professionals

The types of information security positions can be broken down as follows:

    Definers provide policies, guidelines, and standards and include consultants who do risk assessment and develop the product and technical architectures and senior level individuals within an organization who have a broad knowledge, but not a lot of in-depth knowledge.

    Builders are the real techies who create and install security solutions.

    Monitors administer the security tools, perform the security monitoring function, and improve the processes.
