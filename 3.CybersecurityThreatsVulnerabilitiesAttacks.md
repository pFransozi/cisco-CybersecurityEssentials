# Cybersecurity Threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks

* A threat is the possibility that a harmful event, such as an attack, will occur.
* A vulnerability is a weakness that makes a target susceptible to an attack
* An attack is a deliberate exploitation of a discovered weakness in computer information systems, either as specific targets or merely as targets of opportunity.

## types 

### malware

Malware is a software designed **to disrupt computer operations, or gain access to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission**. Malware has become an umbrella term used to describe all hostile or intrusive software. The term malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. Malware may be obvious and simple to identify or it can be very stealthy and almost impossible to detect.

#### Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses, Logic Bombs, Ransomware, Backdoors and Rootkits

* **viruses**: a virus is malicious executable code attached to another executable file, such as a legitimate program. Most viruses require end-user initiation, and can activate at a specific time or date. **Computer viruses usually spread in one of three ways**: from removable media; from downloads off the Internet; and from email attachments. **In order to avoid detection, a virus mutates**.
* **worms**: **Worms are malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms usually slow down networks.** Whereas a virus requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection, worms no longer require user participation. **After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread very quickly over the network**. Worms share similar patterns. They all have an enabling vulnerability, a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain a payload. Worms are responsible for some of the most devastating attacks on the Internet.
* **trojan horse**: a Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online game. **This malicious code exploits the privileges of the user that runs it**. A Trojan horse differs from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files, or games.
* **logic bombs**: **A logic bomb is a malicious program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code**. **The logic bomb remains inactive until that trigger event happens**. Once activated, **a logic bomb implements a malicious code that causes harm to a computer**. **A logic bomb can sabotage database records, erase files, and attack operating systems or applications**. Cybersecurity specialists recently discovered logic bombs that attack and destroy the hardware components in a workstation or server including the cooling fans, CPU, memory, hard drives and power supplies. The logic bomb overdrives these devices until they overheat or fail.
* **ransomware**: **Ransomware holds a computer system, or the data it contains, captive until the target makes a payment**. **Ransomware usually works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user**. The user must pay a ransom to the criminals to remove the restriction. Some other versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock down the system. Ransomware propagates as a Trojan horse and is the result of a downloaded file or some software weakness. Payment through an untraceable payment system is always the criminal’s goal. Once the victim pays, the criminal supplies a program that decrypts the files or sends an unlock code.
* **backdoor**: A backdoor refers to the program or code introduced by a criminal who has compromised a system. **The backdoor bypasses the normal authentication used to access a system**. **A few common backdoor programs are Netbus and Back Orifice, which both allow remote access to unauthorized system users**. The purpose of the backdoor is to grant the cyber criminals future access to the system even if the organization fixes the original vulnerability used to attack the system. Usually, **criminals have authorized users unknowingly run a Trojan horse program on their machine to install the backdoor**.
* **rootkit**: **A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor**. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer remotely. **Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and modify system files**. **Privilege escalation takes advantage of programming errors or design flaws to grant the criminal elevated access to network resources and data**. It is also common for rootkits to modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect. Often, a user must wipe and reinstall the operating system of a computer infected by a rootkit.

##### Defending Against Malware

* **Antivirus**: though the majority of antivirus suites catch most widespread forms of malware, cyber criminals **always develop and deploy new threats on a daily basis**. Then, the key to an effective antivirus solution is to keep the signatures updates, which means a fingerprint that identifies the characteristics of a piece of malicious code.
* **Up-to-Date Software**: Many forms of malware achieve their objectives through exploitation of vulnerabilities in software, both **in the operating system and applications**. Although operating system vulnerabilities were the main source of problems, today’s **application-level vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk**. Unfortunately, while operating system vendors are becoming more and more responsive to patching, most application vendors are not.

### spam

As one of the most popular services, **email has become a major vulnerability to users and organizations**. **Spam**, also known as junk mail, **is unsolicited email** and in most case it is a method of advertising. Spam can send harmful links, malware, or deceptive content. The end goal is to obtain sensitive information such as a social security number or bank account information. Most spam comes from multiple computers on networks infected by a virus or worm. These compromised computers send out as much bulk email as possible.

Some indicators of spam:

* an email has no subject line
* an email is requesting an update to an account
* the email text has misspelled words or strange punctuation
* links within the email are long and/or cryptic
* an email looks like correspondence from a legitimate business
* the email requests that the user open an attachment

**If a user receives an email that contains one or more of these indicators, he or she should not open the email or any attachments.** It is very common for an organization’s email policy to require a user receiving this type of email to report it to the cyber security staff. Almost all email providers filter spam. Unfortunately, spam still consumes bandwidth, and the recipient's server still has to process the message.

#### Spyware, Adware, and Scareware

* **Spyware**: it is a software that enables a criminal to obtain information about a user's computer activities, which often includes activity trackers, keystroke collection, and data capture. In an attempt to overcome security measures, spyware often modifies security settings. Spyware often bundles itself with legitimate software or with Trojan horses. Many shareware websites are full of spyware.
* **Adware**: it typically displays annoying pop-ups to generate revenue for its authors. The malware may analyze user interests by tracking the websites visited. It can then send pop-up advertising pertinent to those sites. Some versions of software automatically install Adware. Some adware only delivers advertisements, but it is also common for adware to come with spyware.
* **Scareware**: it persuades the user to take a specific action based on fear. Scareware forges pop-up windows that resemble operating system dialogue windows. These windows convey forged messages stating that the system is at risk or needs the execution of a specific program to return to normal operation. In reality, no problems exist, and if the user agrees and allows the mentioned program to execute, malware infects his or her system.

#### Phishing, Spear phishing

* Phishing **is a form of fraud**, by which criminals use email, instant messaging, or other social media to try **to gather information such as login credentials or account information by masquerading as a reputable entity or person**. Phishing occurs when a malicious party sends a fraudulent email disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source. The message intent is to trick the recipient into installing malware on his or her device or into sharing personal or financial information.
* Spear phishing is a **highly targeted phishing attack**. Spear phishing sends customized emails **to a specific person**. The criminal researches the target’s interests before sending the email.

#### Vishing, Smishing, Pharming, and Whaling

* Vishing is phishing **using voice communication technology**. Criminals can spoof calls from legitimate sources using voice over IP (VoIP) technology. Victims may also receive a recorded message that appears legitimate. **Vishing takes advantage of the fact that people trust the telephone network**.
* Smishing (Short Message Service phishing) is phishing using **text messaging on mobile phones**. Criminals impersonate a legitimate source in an attempt to gain the trust of the victim. It uses Short Message Service (SMS) to send fake text messages. The criminals trick the user into visiting a website or calling a phone number. Unsuspecting victims may then provide sensitive information such as credit card information. Visiting a website might result in the user unknowingly downloading malware that infects the device.
* Pharming is the **impersonation of a legitimate website in an effort to deceive users into entering their credentials**. Pharming misdirects users to a fake website that appears to be official. Victims then enter their personal information thinking that they connected to a legitimate site.
* Whaling is a phishing attack that **targets high profile targets within an organization such as senior executives**. Additional targets include politicians or celebrities.

### Browser Plugins and Browser Poisoning

Security breaches can affect web browsers by displaying pop-up advertising, collecting personally identifiable information, or installing adware, viruses, or spyware.

* **SEO Poisoning**: **SEO, short for Search Engine Optimization, is a set of techniques used to improve a website’s ranking by a search engine**. While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, SEO poisoning uses SEO to make a malicious website appear higher in search results. **The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or perform social engineering.** To force a malicious site to rank higher in search results, attackers take advantage of popular search terms.
* **Browser Hijacker**: A browser hijacker is malware that **alters a computer's browser settings to redirect the user to websites paid for by the cyber criminals' customers**. Browser hijackers usually install without the user's permission and are usually part of a drive-by download. A drive-by download is a program that automatically downloads to the computer when a user visits a web site or views an HTML email message. Always read user agreements carefully when downloading programs to avoid this type of malware.

### Defending Against Email and Browser Attacks

Methods for dealing with spam **include filtering email, educating the user about being cautious towards unknown email(s), and using host/server filters**. It is not possible to stop spam, but there are ways to reduce its effects, such as ISPs, filtering spam before it reaches the user's inbox.

Another important approach is **a process of aware of employees about** the dangers of opening email attachments that may contain a virus or a worm. The first principle is assume that email attachments are not safe, even when they come from a trusted contact, for a trusted contact can be a means to the process of spreading a virus.

The **Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)** is an industry association focused on eliminating the identity theft and fraud that result from phishing and email spoofing.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering is a completely non-technical means for a criminal to gather information on a target, with an attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful but also prey on people’s weaknesses.

These are some types of social engineering attacks:

* **Pretexting**: This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data. An example involves an attacker who pretends to need personal or financial data in order to confirm the identity of the recipient.
* **Something for Something (Quid pro quo)**: This is when an attacker requests personal information from a party in exchange for something, like a gift.

#### Social Engineering Tactics

Social engineers rely on several tactics, which include:

* **Authority**: people are more likely to comply when instructed by “an authority”.
* **Intimidation**: criminals bully a victim into taking action.
* **Consensus/Social Proof**: people will take action if they think that other people like it too.
* **Scarcity**: people will take action when they think there is a limited quantity.
* **Urgency**: people will take action when they think there is a limited time.
* **Familiarity/Liking**: Criminals build a rapport with the victim to establish a relationship. People are more likely to do what another person asks if they like that person.
* **Trust**: Criminals build a trusting relationship with a victim which may require more time to establish. A *security expert* calls the victim offering advice and having the credentials to back it up. While helping the victim, the criminal discovers a *serious error* that needs immediate attention. The solution provides the criminal with the opportunity.

**Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for educating others in the organization to the tactics of social engineers**. [https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1350956]

### others non-technical threats

#### Shoulder Surfing and Dumpster Diving

A criminal observes, or shoulder surfs, to pick up PINs, access codes or credit card numbers. An attacker can be in close proximity to his victim or the attacker can use binoculars or closed circuit cameras to shoulder surf. That is one reason that a person can only read an ATM screen at certain angles. These types of safeguards make shoulder surfing much more difficult.

Dumpster diving is the process of going through a target's trash to see what information an organization throws out. Consider securing the trash receptacle. Any sensitive information should be properly disposed of through shredding or the use of burn bags, a container that holds classified or sensitive documents for later destruction by fire.

#### Impersonation and Hoaxes

**Impersonation is the action of pretending to be someone else**. A criminal, posing as an IRS employee, told the victims that they owed money to the IRS. The victims must pay immediately through a wire transfer. The impersonator threatened that failure to pay will result in an arrest. Criminals also use impersonation to attack others. They can undermine the credibility of individuals by using website or social media postings.

**A hoax is an act intended to deceive or trick**. A cyber hoax can cause just as much disruption as an actual breach would cause. A hoax elicits a user reaction. The reaction can create unnecessary fear and irrational behavior. Users pass hoaxes through email and social media. Click here to visit a website that lists hoax messages.

Grayware is becoming a problem area in mobile security with the popularity of smartphones. Grayware includes applications that behave in an annoying or undesirable manner. Grayware may not have recognizable malware concealed within, but it still may pose a risk to the user. For example, Grayware can track the user’s location. The authors of grayware usually maintain legitimacy by including an application’s capabilities in the small print of the software license agreement. Users install many mobile apps without really considering their capabilities.

#### Piggybacking and Tailgating

**Piggybacking occurs when a criminal tags along with an authorized person to gain entry into a secure location or a restricted area**. Criminals use several methods to piggyback:

* They give the appearance of being escorted by the authorized individual
* They join a large crowd pretending to be a member
* They target a victim who is careless about the rules of the facility

**A mantrap prevents piggybacking by using two sets of doors. After individuals enter an outer door, that door must close before entering the inner door**.

#### Online, Email, and Web-based Deception

**Forwarding hoax emails and other jokes, funny movies, and non-work-related emails at work may violate the company's acceptable use policy and result in disciplinary actions**.

#### Defending Against Deception

**Organizations need to promote awareness of social engineering tactics and properly educate employees on prevention measures, such as the following**:

* Never provide confidential information or credentials via email, chat sessions, in-person, or on the phone to unknown parties.
* Resist the urge to click on enticing emails and website links.
* Keep an eye out for uninitiated or automatic downloads.
* Establish policies and educate employees about those policies.
* When it comes to security, give employees a sense of ownership.
* Do not fall to pressure from unknown individuals.

### Denial of Service

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack, which results in some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications, and are relatively simple to conduct, even by an unskilled attacker. The main goal is of a DoS attack is to deny access to authorized users making the network unavailable and broking availability principle. (remember the three underlying security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability). There are two major types of DoS attacks:

* **Overwhelming Quantity of Traffic**: The attacker sends an enormous quantity of data at a rate that the network, host, or application cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or a crash of a device or service.
* **Maliciously Formatted Packets**: The attacker sends a maliciously formatted packet to a host or application and the receiver is unable to handle it. For example, an application cannot identify packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets forwarded by the attacker. This causes the receiving device to run very slowly or crash.

**A Distributed DoS Attack (DDoS) is similar to a DoS attack, but it originates from multiple, coordinated sources.** **An attacker builds a network of infected hosts, called a botnet, comprised of zombies. Zombies are the infected hosts. The attacker uses handler systems to control the zombies. The zombie computers constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more zombies. When ready, the hacker instructs the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack**.

### Sniffing

Sniffing is similar to eavesdropping on someone. It occurs when attackers examine all network traffic as it passes through their NIC, independent of whether or not the traffic is addressed to them or not. Sniffing views all network traffic or it can target a specific protocol, service, or even string of characters such as a login or password. Some network sniffers observe all traffic and modify some or all of the traffic as well.

Sniffing also has its benefits. Network administrators may also use sniffers to analyze network traffic, identify bandwidth issues, and troubleshoot other network issues. Physical security is important in preventing the introduction of sniffers on the internal network.

### Spoofing

Spoofing is an impersonation attack, and it takes advantage of a trusted relationship between two systems. If two systems accept the authentication accomplished by each other, an individual logged onto one system might not go through an authentication process again to access the other system. An attacker can take advantage of this arrangement by sending a packet to one system that appears to have come from a trusted system. Since the trusted relationship is in place, the targeted system may perform the requested task without authentication.

There are multiple types of spoofing attacks.

* MAC address spoofing occurs when one computer accepts data packets based on the MAC address of another computer.
* IP spoofing sends IP packets from a spoofed source address to disguise itself.
* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for transmitting data. ARP spoofing sends spoofed ARP messages across a LAN to link the criminal’s MAC address with the IP address of an authorized member of the network.
* The Domain Name System (DNS) associates domain names with IP addresses. DNS server spoofing modifies the DNS server to reroute a specific domain name to a different IP address controlled by the criminal.

### Man-in-the-middle

A criminal performs **a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack** by intercepting communications between computers to steal information crossing the network. The criminal can also choose to manipulate messages and relay false information between hosts since the hosts are unaware that a modification to the messages occurred. MitM allows the criminal to take control over a device without the user’s knowledge.

**Man-In-The-Mobile (MitMo) is** a variation of man-in-middle. MitMo takes control over a mobile device. The infected mobile device sends user-sensitive information to the attackers.
**ZeuS, an example of an exploit with MitMo capabilities, allows attackers quietly to capture 2-step verification SMS messages sent to users.**

**A replay attack occurs** when an attacker captures a portion of a communication between two hosts and then retransmits the captured message later. Replay attacks circumvent authentication mechanisms.

### Zero-Day Attacks

A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, is a computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor. The term zero hour describes the moment when someone discovers the exploit. During the time it takes the software vendor to develop and release a patch, the network is vulnerable to these exploits, as shown in the figure. Defending against these fast-moving attacks requires network security professionals to adopt a more sophisticated view of the network architecture. It is no longer possible to contain intrusions at a few points in the network.

### Keyboard Logging
 
Keyboard logging is a software program that records or logs the keystrokes of the user of the system. Criminals can implement keystroke loggers through software installed on a computer system or through hardware physically attached to a computer. The criminal configures the key logger software to email the log file. The keystrokes captured in the log file can reveal usernames, passwords, websites visited, and other sensitive information.

Keyboard loggers can be legitimate, commercial software. Parents often purchase key logger software to track the websites and behavior of children using the Internet. Many anti-spyware applications are able to detect and remove unauthorized key loggers. Although keylogging software is legal, criminals use the software for illegal purposes.

### Rogue Access Points

A rogue access point is a wireless access point installed on a secure network without explicit authorization. **Wireless signals are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio-frequency interference (RFI), and may even be susceptible to lightning strikes or noise from fluorescent lights**. Wireless signals are also susceptible to deliberate jamming. Radio frequency (RF) jamming disrupts the transmission of a radio or satellite station so that the signal does not reach the receiving station.

The frequency, modulation, and power of the RF jammer needs to be equal to that of the device that the criminal wants to disrupt in order to successfully jam the wireless signal.

### Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing

Bluetooth is a short-range, low-power protocol. Bluetooth transmits data in a personal area network, or PAN, and can include devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and printers. Bluetooth has gone through several version releases. Easy configuration is a characteristic of Bluetooth, so there is no need for network addresses. Bluetooth uses pairing to establish the relationship between devices. When establishing the pairing, both devices use the same passkey.

Bluetooth vulnerabilities have surfaced, but due to the limited range of Bluetooth, the victim and the attacker need to be within range of each other.

WEP also has several problems with i94.44 out of 100.00ts initialization vector (IV) which is one of the components of the cryptographic system:

* It is a 24-bit field, which is too small.
* It is cleartext, which means it is readable.
* It is static so identical key streams will repeat on a busy network.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and then WPA2 came out as improved protocols to replace WEP. WPA2 does not have the same encryption problems because an attacker cannot recover the key by observing traffic. WPA2 is susceptible to attack because cyber criminals can analyze the packets going between the access point and a legitimate user. Cyber criminals use a packet sniffer and then run attacks offline on the passphrase.

### Code Injection

One way to store data at a website is to use a database. There are several different types of databases such as a Structured Query Language (SQL) database or an Extensible Markup Language (XML) database. Both XML and SQL injection attacks exploit weaknesses in the program such as not validating database queries properly.

* **XML Injection**: When using an XML database, an XML injection is an attack that can corrupt the data. After the user provides input, the system accesses the required data via a query. The problem occurs when the system does not properly scrutinize the input request provided by the user. Criminals can manipulate the query by programming it to suit their needs and can access the information on the database. All sensitive data stored in the database is accessible to the criminals and they can make any number of changes to the website. An XML injection attack threatens the security of the website.
* **SQL Injection**: The cybercriminal exploits a vulnerability by inserting a malicious SQL statement in an entry field. Again, the system does not filter the user input correctly for characters in an SQL statement. Criminals use SQL injection on websites or any SQL database. Criminals can spoof an identity, modify existing data, destroy data, or become administrators of the database server.

### Remote Code Executions

Vulnerabilities allow a cybercriminal to execute malicious code and take control of a system with the privileges of the user running the application, through remote code execution.

### ActiveX Controls and **Java**

When browsing the web, some pages may not work properly unless the user installs an ActiveX control. ActiveX controls provide the capability of a plugin to Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls are pieces of software installed by users to provide extended capabilities. Third parties write some ActiveX controls and they may be malicious. They can monitor browsing habits, install malware, or log keystrokes. ActiveX controls also work in other Microsoft applications.

Java operates through an interpreter, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM enables the Java program’s functionality. The JVM sandboxes or isolates untrust#### 3.2.2.2 Impersonation and Hoaxes

The first line of defense against an application attack is to write solid code. Regardless of the language used, or the source of outside input, prudent programming practice is to treat all input from outside a function as hostile. Validate all inputs as if they were hostile.

Keep all software including operating systems and applications up to date, and do not ignore update prompts. Not all programs update automatically. At the very least, select the manual update option. Manual updates allow users to see exactly what updates take place.

## defending against attacks

Configure firewalls to discard any packets from outside of the network that have addresses indicating that they originated from inside the network. This situation does not normally occur, and it indicates that a cybercriminal attempted a spoofing attack.

**To prevent DoS and DDoS attacks, ensure patches and upgrades are current, distribute the workload across server systems, and block external Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets at the border**. Network devices use ICMP packets to send error messages. For example, the ping command uses ICMP packets to verify that a device can communicate with another on the network.

### Defending Against Wireless and Mobile Device Attacks

There are several steps to take to defend against wireless and mobile device attacks. Most WLAN products use default settings. Take advantage of the basic wireless security features such as authentication and encryption by changing the default configuration settings.
